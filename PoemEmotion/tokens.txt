to
the
freeze
air
or
in
wild
despair

lie
behind

that
curl
they
limb
at
touch
of
air
and
die
with
metallic
sigh
why
care
I
for

quick
sterile
sting

tell
and
tell
again
that
I
shall
find

peace
and

and
round
cymbal
richly
clash
and
anklet
jingle
jingling
jingling
beneath
the
fiery
gulmohur
with
long
braid

dark
eye
flash
they

and
they
dance
oh

dance
till
they
blow

cheek
jasmine
in
they
hair
some
be
dark
and
some
be
almost
fair
they
voice
be
harsh
they
song
melancholy
they
sing
of
lover
die
and
or
child
leave
unborn
some
beat
they
drum
other
beat
they
sorry
breast
and
wail
and
writhe
in
vacant
ecstasy
they
be
thin
in
limb
and
dry
like
half
burn
log
from
funeral
pyre
a
drought
and
a
rottenness
be
in
each
of
they
even
the
crow
be
so
silent
on
tree
and
the
child
wide
eye
still
all
be
watch
this
poor
creature
convulsion
the
sky
crackle
then
thunder
come
and
lightning
and
rain
a
meagre
rain
that
smelt
of
dust
in
attic
and
the
urine
of
lizard
and
mouse
the
freak
he
talk
turn
a
cheek
to
I
he
mouth
a
dark
cavern
where
stalactite
of
uneven
tooth
gleam
he
right
hand
on
my
knee
while
we
mind
be
will
to
race
towards
love
but
they
only
wander
trip
idly
over
puddle
of
desire
can
this
man
with
nimble
finger
tip
unleash
nothing
more
alive
than
the
skin
lazy
hunger
who
can
help
we
who
have
live
so
long
and
have
fail
in
love
the
heart
a
empty
cistern
wait
through
long
hour
fill
itself
with
coiling
snake
of
silence
I
be
a
freak
it
be
only
to
save
my
face
I
flaunt
at
time
a
grand
flamboyant
lust
the
look

a
man
to
love
you
be
easy
only

honest
about

more
soft
young
lovely
admit

the
perfection
of

redden
under
the
shower

towel
and
the
jerky
way

all
the
fond
detail
that
make
he
male
and
you
only
man
gift
he
all
gift
he
what
make
you
woman
the
scent
of
long
hair
the
musk
of
sweat
between
the
breast
the
warm
shock
of
menstrual
blood
and
all
you
endless
female
hunger
oh
yes
get
a
man
to
love
be
easy
but
live
without

afterwards
may
have
to
be
face
a
living
without

when
you
move
around

with
you

for
the
last
time
and
leave

so
dead
that
he
ask
what
be
wrong
do
you
mind
my
kiss
love
and
she
say
no
not
at
all
but
think
what
be
it
to
the
corpse
if
the
maggot
nip
the
old
playhouse
you
plan
to
tame
a
swallow
to
hold
she
in
the
long
summer
of
you
love
so
that
she
would
forget
not
the
raw
season
alone
and
the
home
leave
behind
but
also
she
nature
the
urge
to
fly
and
the
endless
pathway
of
the
sky
it
be
not
to
gather
knowledge
of
yet
another
man
that
I
come
to
you
but
to
learn
what
I
be
and
by
learn
to
learn
to
grow
but
every
lesson
you
give
be
about
yourself
you
be
pleased
with
my
body
response
its
weather
its
usual
shallow
convulsion
you
dribble
spittle
into
my
mouth
you
pour
yourself
into
every
nook
and
cranny
you
embal
my
poor
lust
with
you
bitter
sweet
juice
you
call
I
wife
I
be
teach
to
break
saccharine
into
you
tea
and
to
offer
at
the
right
moment
the
vitamin
cower
beneath
you
monstrous
ego
I
eat
the
magic
loaf
and
become
a
dwarf
I
lose
my
will
and
reason
to
all
you
question
I
mumble
incoherent
reply
the
summer
begin
to
pall
I
remember
the
rudder
breeze
of
the
fall
and
the
smoke
from
the
burning
leave
you
room
be
always
light
by
artificial
light
you
window
always
shut
even
the
air
conditioner

so
little
all
pervasive
be
the
male
scent
of
you
breath
the
cut
flower
in
the
vase
have
begin
to
smell
of
human
sweat
there
be
no
more
singing
no
more
dance
my
mind
be
a
old
playhouse
with
all
its
light
put
out
the
strong
man
technique
be
always
the
same
he
serve
he
love
in
lethal
dose
for
love
be
narcissus
at
the
water
edge
haunt
by
its
own
lonely
face
and
yet
it
must
seek
at
last
a
end
a
pure
total
freedom
it
must
will
the
mirror
to
shatter
and
the
kind
night
to
erase
the
water
the
rain
we
leave
that
old
ungainly
house
when
my
dog
die
there
after
the
burial
after
the
rose
flower
twice
pull
it
by
its
root
and
cart
it
with

book
clothes
and

new
house

shabby
room
and

pit
face
absent
mindedly
while

with
loud
talk

bruise
my
sleep

a
finger
into
my
dreaming
eye
and

sun
in
the
swell
of
my
dravidian
blood

drain
beneath
sacred
city
when
you
leave
I
drive
my
blue
batter
car
along
the
bluer
sea

pluck

kill
instantly
the
people
and
the
city
and
the

and
even
the
pitiable
babybird
who
be
yet
to
learn
to
fly
they
contemplate
of
write
poem
about
a
bird
egg
charring
before
even

scratch
they
beak
unsure
if
this
be
a

poetic
device
of
the
bird
have
lot
and
lot
and
lot
to
write
about
of
they
writings
will
never
be
ban
they
borrow
freedom
to
write
poem
in
the
sky
they
come
back
and
pass
it
on
to
we
we
take
the
song
only
brutally
but
at
least
we
take
the
song
to
take
the
poem
to
unscramble
the
word
from
the
song
and
to
put
it
back
again
as
song
so
spontaneously
that
it
remain
the
poem
and
the
song
to
remember
forever
this
refrain
whose
melody
haunt
we
and
to
hum
that
refrain
which
preserve
we
sanity
perhaps
we
need
to
fly
a
trifle
aimlessly
like
bird
or
because
we
be
human
six
sense
creature
with
massive
ego
and
massive
superego
and
massive
ego
on
the
ego
and
because
of
possess
gray
matter
what
doctor
call
medulla
oblongata
we
need
to
feel
with
we
red
heart
than
think
with
some
unlocatable
mind
we
need
to
look
deep
into
ourselves
into
eye
we
need
to
lose
ourselves
then
and
only
then
the
poem
will
come
silent
wordless
as
the
flight
of
bird
blackboard
poem
p
a
c
email
be
a
problem
unlike
you
never
end
paper
or
the
maddening
blankness
of
you
word
processor
where
you
can
go
on
and
on
in
anguish
or
insanity
or
boredom
on
one
hundred

seven
degree
fahrenheit
afternoon
to
write
the
next
line
you
need
to
take
the
duster
to
rub
off
this
eight
colour
be
another
confusion
you
want
to
wish
away
at
sixteen
you
would
not
write

unless
it
be
forty
percent
gray
letter
on
a

and
you

look

at

I
have

nothing

like
you
own

the
white
chalk
dancing
across

green

on

on

on

I
have
erase
again
I
do
not
grudge
the
colour
too
instead
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
six
fantasy
there
be
the
catholic
bridal
white
sometimes
there
be
yellow

I

there
be
considerable

let
I
hazard
a

writing
take
two
hundred
calorie
per

erase
with
the

five
hundred
and
walk

must
be

then
there
be
chalk
dust
allergy
that
compel
I
to
sneeze
and
the
chemical
after
effect
that
spoil
the
moody
brown
skin
of
any
glow
goddess
and
the
unbearable
sound
of
chalk
squeak
I
have
erase
again
the
fifth
time
now
but
a
poet
love
write
blackboard
poem
so
easy
to
imagine
a
audience
yet
how
much
she
dread
impermanence
return
home
and
you
see
the
two
crow
for
joy
pass
that
be
sit
on
overhead
cable
and
the
evening
moon
a
mere
silvery
slice
against
fluffy
translucent
sky
and
the
remains
of
you
school
where
you
spend
you
twelve
long
year
and
live
through
everything
and
the
bus
you
have
to
draw
for
you
art
class
in
yellow
ochre
or
asphalt
grey
and
the
emptiness
that
now
occupy
the
place
where
a
tiny
café
once
stand
and
the
tree
where
they
feed
you
lunch
before
you
learn
to
walk
back
home
and
I
think
of
my
parent
brilliant
people
talk
of
the
intricacy
of
they
life
and
the
corruption
of
moral
and
the
bygone
day
and
hunger
in
they
childhood
and
they
deaddear
depart
parent
as
if
to
teach
you
what
to
talk
to
you
child
and
you
be
they
child
so
you
speak
they
line
still
return
home
and
there
be
rusty
mammoth
girder
that
outline
the
sky
like
the
derelict
of
lose
dream
and
cross
hope
and
girl
so
flimsy
pretty
yet
unsafe
in
the
little
world
of
lip
gloss
and
love
affair
that
you
could
have
smoke
they
into
oblivion
and
the
dry
decay
dead
leave
crush
with
vary
noise
and
carry
a
spend
smell
that
cling
to
you
hair
and
the
shy
forest
noise
that
violate
you
fixation
over
sight
and
sound
and
smell
and
touch
yes
touch
and
I
think
of
my
lover
a
primitive
man
who
would
invade
you
aloneness
on
insomniac
night
and
challenge
you
assumption
of
love
and
you
sophistication
and
fill
you
ear
with
the
four
letter
word
of
he
ancient
language
that
have
begin
to
sound
to
you
like
earth
song
to
which
you
body
awaken
and
you
be
he
love
so
you
listen
to
he
line
on
the
way
home
the
small
lesson
you
learn
of
life
love
or
the
promise
of
love
its
lack
of
choice
this
large
world
and
its
littleness
cinquain
morning
song
wet
pink
and
dusty
grey
the
sky
begin
to
blush
some
sleepy
careless
charm
welcome
daybreak
even
song
azure
and
pink
gold
hue
the
smug
sky
at
twilight
a
final
flush
of
fulfilment
night
falls
how
they
prostitute
a
poem
it
be
uniquely
easy
for
some
to
sell
ideal
because
business
of
absent
goods
be
essentially
a
sacrosanct
but
mostly
a
flimsy
transaction
some
learn
early
on
to
prostitute
they
verse
so
in
all
the
wake
hour
they
scavenge
for
a
simple
simile
that
match
requirement
fulfill
need
they
barter
reality
and
every
romance
to
a
blurred
triplicate
carbon
copy
world
of
hard
cash
and
price
tag
and
brand
name
in
this
brothel
of
still
hope
and
stagnate
story
poem
be
bear
virgin
and
endow
with
voluptuous
figure
of
firm
full
breast
and
wide
hip
where
man
prefer
to
plant
they
pastime
dream
or
conceive
they
seed
or
merely
spite
themselves
or
dabble
at
domination
but
the
poem
with
this
bogus
existence
become
a
adept
untiring
prostitute
take
on
a
starry
night
the
poem
open
dry
and
drab
and
dreary
lack
love
and
life
like
the
pay
for
parting
of
the
thigh
sun
in
the
mouth
and
the
truth
scorch
and
sing
the
pink
open
flesh
of
you
mouth
with
its
pungent
yellow
taste
so
speak
the
truth
be
not
so
easy
with
just
one
tongue
anyway
see
might
have
be
close
to
truth
and
as
plotinus
say
the
eye
would
not
be
able
to
see
the
sun
if
it
be
itself
not
sun
and
so
see
be
understanding
the
Egyptians
call
the
eye
with
the
circle
of
the
iris
with
the
pupil
in
the
centre
as
the
sun
in

mouth
and
that
be
they
truth
cyclop
must
have
have
little
to
see
in
this
vast
world
and
deprive
of
the
whole
truth
and
that
be
he
loss
he
tragedy
even
argus
with
all
he
eye
could
not
escape
in
the
end
how
much
truth
how
many

of
how
many

would
it
take
to
tell
the

to
the

a

a
tamil
temple
city
rage
mad

of
the
scent
of
a

since
money
buy

he
make

a
poor

the

lord
of

and
say
that

he
say
that
any

the

down
to

this
stubborn

who
extend
he
truth
even
if
the

lord
he
would
not
budge
even
if

which
would
reduce

to
bone
white
ash
as
light
as
the
wispy
cloud
the

in

the

untranslatable
dharma
they
say
mean
justice
integrity
veracity
righteousness
and

and
you
carry

understand
sometimes
highly
frustrated
with
the
cruelty
and
apathy
of
everything
you
even
resort
to
blame
karma
and
you
begin
to
trace
past

about
the
enormity

very
quickly
I
choose

tell
I
of

I
really
want
to
take

instead
I

what
you
do
not

speak
in

in

that
could
only

I
be

writer
at

we
both
have
something
in

look
here
comrade
my
credential
be
different
in

I
be
a

a

before
the

long
long
ago
I
be
a
mighty
monarch
on

I
be

my

be
happy

and
I
rule
for
twelve
thousand
year
until
the
day
when
I
decide
that
I
could
take
leave
of
life
in
heaven
too
I
be
venerate
but
one
question
have
plag
I
all
the
year
of
my
long
life
and
it
still
torment
I
in
heaven
I
want
to
know
why
caste
be
there
why
people
suffer
because
of
they
karma
I
question
the
god
and
the
learn
sage
there
I
ask
they
what
would
happen
if
a
high
bear
do
manual
work
just
like
the
low
bear
I
worry
about
the
division
of
labor
this
disparity
in
dream
and
destiny
you
could
say
I
be
a
rebel
plead
for
liberty
equality
fraternity
I
have
a
riotous
history
of
revolution
the
god
plot
against
I
decide
that
I
be
trouble
I
be
curse
to
turn
into
a
vile
snake
I
be
banish
from
paradise
for
sixty
million
year
I
shall
roam
the
earth
and
then
I
may
return
this
be
a
different
case
of
the
paradise
lose
in
this
tale
there
be
no
forbidden
fruit
no
second
fickle
minded
woman
tradition
triumph
over
reason
and
the
good
be
cast
away
I
let
the
serpent
go
happy
that
he
have
give
my
hungry
mind
a
story
or
perhaps
a
poem
to
be
write
on
unfair
day
I
begin
to
respect
snake
the
challenger
of
hierarchy
while
I
give
he
the
freedom
of
safe
passage
I
vow
never
to
kill
serpent
much
late
I
realize
brutally
that
this
be
just
another
occupational
hazard
for
choose
a
life
where
I
be
to
be
show
solidarity
with
activist
and
dissenter
aggression
ours
be
a
silence
that
wait
endlessly
wait
and
then
unable
to
bear
it
any
further
it
break
into
wail
but
not
all
suppress
reaction
end
in
we
bemoan
the
tragedy
sometimes
the
outward
signal
of
inward
struggle
take
colossal
form
and
the
revolution
happen
because
we
dream
explode
most
of
the

will
you

no

I
through
you

one
more
final
question
can
my
untouchable
atman
and
you
brahmin
atman
ever
be
one
touch
have
you
ever
try
meditation
struggle
hard
to

and
keep
you
mind
as
blank
as
a
whitewash
wall
by
close
you
eye
nose
ear
and
shut
out
every
possible
thought
every
thing
and
the
only
failure
that
ever
come
the
only
gross
betrayal
be
from
you
own
skin
you
will
have
know
this
do
you

and
perhaps
because

there
be
the
poem
where
the

where
the
king
be
praise
where

with

turn
in
fright
where
the

and
will
be
if
everything

about
I
we
will
look
beyond

and
run
into
each
other
as

for
the
rest
of
life
I
do
not
know
what
you
would
treasure
of
I
in
you
mind
but
in
billboards
plant
across
my
fervent
heart
I
will
celebrate
you
as
the
man
who
make
I

all
you
delicious
lie
over

the
sound
of
you
drinking

the
soundlessness
of

the
camouflage
of
who
you
be
talk
to
the
new
meaning
you
give
to
wear
out
word
yes

of
this
and
that
once

a
goddess
monologue
I
speak
alone
because

and
yet
you
want
to
be

want
to
tell

can
hurt
I
have
exile

world
even
with
a
lover
since
I

the
difference
between

nothing
I
have

today
I
turn
into
a
whore
hunting
for
word
tear
they
out
from
soil
sheet
of
mind
or
pinch
they
from
the
world
like
remove
jade
green
fleck
from
tiger
eye
and
poetry
refuse
entry
into
my
mirror
life
that
be
bequeath
to
he
I
try
the
mad
woman
antic
I
have
pull
my
hair
and
bruise
my
thin
wrist
and
bite
the
inside
of
my
cheek
till
they
have
blow
a
warm
red
sourness
and
I
have
starve
in
arrogance
to
call
the
word
home
to
I
and
throw
up
to
clear
I
of
he
but
he
strong
dark
man
refuse
to
budge
give
way
or
take
leave
my
dark
night
of
savage
tear
have
go
in
search
of
needy
shore
desert
I
with
the
devil
of
a
lover
who
sleep
half
a
dozen
stream
apart
and
so
have
the
word
that
once
make
I
the
sad
lone
woman
I
be
and
pretend
to
be

be
happy
now

say
and
I
node
like
a
tanjore
doll
in
breeze
and
reply
in
cloying
tone
this
be
happiness
I
know
I
do
not
indulge
in
lie
or
delusion
but
this
be
happiness
and
happiness
be
a
hollow
world
for
fool
to
inhabit
where
all
the
dream
eventually
die
by
come
to
life
love
have
smother
I
to
a
gay
inertia
and
I
long
for
a
little
hurt
and
pain
that
will
let
I
scream
and
I
wait
for
offend
word
to
row
I
into
world
where
I
shall
cry
wildly
for
whole
night
like
the
lament
of
lonely
old
and
greyy
sea
then
sadness
shall
come
back
with
its
dancing
fairy
light
and
nail
I
to
wail
cross
poetry
in
the
end
shall
replace
all
of
he
with
a
lover
do
not
talk
to
I
of
sudden

in
we
land
even
the

I
dream
of
a
English
full
of
the
word
of
my
language
a
English
in
small
letter
a
English
that
shall
tire
a
white
man
tongue
a
English
where
small
child
practice
with
smooth
round
pebble
in
they
mouth
to
the
spell
the
right
zha
a
English
where
a
pregnant
woman
be
simply
stomach
child
lady
a
English
where
the
magic
of
black
eye
and
brown
body
replace
the
glamour
of
eye
in
dishwater
blue
shade
and
the
airbrush
romance
of
pink
white
cherry
blossom
skin
a
English
where
love
mean
only
the
strange
frenzy
between
a
man
and
he
beloved
not
between
he
and
he
car
a
English
without
the
privacy
of
its
many
room
a
English
with
suffix
for
respect
a
English
with
more
than
thirty
six
word
to
call
the
sea
a
English
that
do
not
belittle
brown
or
black
man
and
woman
a
English
of
tasting
with
five
finger
a
English
of
talk
love
with
eye
alone
and
I
dream
of
a
English
where
man
of
that
spiky
crunchy
tongue
buy
flower
garland
of
jasmine
to
take
home
to
they
coy
wife
for
the
silent
demand
of
a
night
of
wordless
whisper
love
you
do
not
know
if
you
be
yield
or
resist
it
be
the
last
day
of
the
year
and
you
think
about
write
a
farewell
poem
for
the
year
that
be
for
the
year
you
begin
write
poetry
you
think
of
the
tragedy
you
know
you
even
plan
to
write
about
name
you
only
daughter
whenever
she
be
bear
anyway
after
a
suicide
bomber
you
try
to
think
of
fear
and
hate
and
some
devious
defence
for
all
that
sin
you
have
painstakingly
plan
to
do
just
so
that
you
poetry
have
more
life
and
colour
and
verve
and
in
the
end
it
might
appear
that
you
have
experience
you
strive
like
mad
to
avoid
write
poem
about
you
unseen
lover
you
concede
deep
within
that
you
do
not
know
he
name
or
age
or
what
he
murder
for
a
living
yet
he
weave
he
way
into
every
poem
of
yours
you
want
to
write
that
single
poem
which
be
free
of
he
which
do
not
carry
the
stain
of
he
masculine
scent
and
which
do
not
make
you
think
of
he
hairless
chest
and
the
deftness
of
he
finger
on
you
and
god
yes
god
he
eye
you
want
to
write
a
poem
just
for
yourself
a
poem
where
you
do
not
cringe
or
stand
shame
face
at
he
worship
of
himself
and
how
silently
and
steadfastly
he
have
make
you
worship
he
you
have
always
know
that
you
knowledge
of
he
be
very
limit
that
expect
the
stranger
to
caress
you
when
you
cry
be
a
insane
idea
after
all
when
you
lover
come
he
have
no
memory
about
the
day
and
month
and
year
he
have
spend
inside
you
heart
and
he
do
not
wish
to
hear
for
how
long
you
have
harbour
he
right
between
you
breast
you
notice
the
clock
tick
away
and
again
you
give
up
writing
that
poem
for
it
always
elude
you
then
you
succumb
to
all
you
craving
and
write
all
you
can
about
he
forget
the
shame
and
the
embarrassment
it
would
cause
somehow
it
seem
good
than
not

no
vision
of
a

through

oh
dip
my
empty
life
into
that
ocean
plunge
it
into
the
deep
fullness
let
I
for
once
feel
that

touch
in

shall
weave
a
chain
of

anklet
of

hang
upon
thy
breast

from
thee
and
it

for
thee
to
give
or
to

absolutely
mine
own
and
when
I
bring
it
to
thee
as
my
offering

rewardest
I
with
thy
grace
close
path
I
think
that
my
voyage

come
to
its

at

last
limit
of
my
power
that
the
path
before
I
be
close
that
provision

exhaust
and
the
time
come
to
take
shelter
in
a
silent
obscurity
but
I
find
that
thy
will
know
no
end
in
I
and
when
old
word
die
out
on
the
tongue
new
melody
break
forth
from
the
heart
and
where

up
into

I
lose
sight
of
my
true
being
in
its
dark
shadow
I
take
pride
in

great
wall
and
I
plaster
it
with

hole
should
be
leave
in

for
all
the

before
thee

among

I
stand
before

simplicity
of
a
tune
the
traveler
have
to
knock
at
every
alien
door
to
come
to
he
own
and

have
to
wander
through

wide
before
I

shall
be
lose
and
life
will
take
its
leave
in
silence
draw
the
last
curtain
over
my
eye

star
will
watch
at
night
and
morning
rise
as
before
and
hour
heave
like
sea
wave

up
pleasure
and
pain
when
I
think
of
this
end
of
my
moment

barrier
of
the
moment
break
and
I
see
by
the
light
of
death
thy
world

its
careless
treasure
rare
be
its
lowly
seat
rare
be
its
mean
of

that
I
long
for
in

think
I
could
outdo
everybody
in
the
world
in
wealth
and
power
and
I
amass
in
my
own
treasure
house
the
money
due
to
my
king
when

overcame
I
I
lay
upon
the

I
in
a
freedom
undisturbed
thus
night
and

I
work
at

and
cruel
hard

the
link

be
like
a
remnant
of

in
the
sky
of
my
sun
ever
glorious
thy
touch
have
not

thus
I
count
month

separate
from
thee
if
this
be

take
this
fleeting
emptiness

mine
paint
it
with
color
gild
it
with
gold
float
it
on

wanton
wind
and
spread
it
in
varied
wonder
and
again
when
it
shall
be
thy
wish
to
end
this
play
at
night
I
shall
melt
and
vanish
away
in

it
may
be
in
a
smile
of
the
white
morning
in
a
coolness
of
purity
transparent

away

we
should
sail
in
a
boat
only
thou
and
I
and
never
a
soul
in
the
world
would
know
of
this
we
pilgrimage
to
no
country
and
to
no
end
in
that
shoreless
ocean
at
thy
silently
listen
smile
my
song
would
swell
in
melody
free
as
wave

bloom
in
my
youthful
limb

a
glow
in

sky
before
the
sunrise
heaven
first
darling
twain
bear
with
the
morning
light
you
have
float
down
the
stream
of
the
world
life
and
at
last
you
have
strand
on
my
heart
as
I
gaze
on
you
face
mystery
overwhelm
I
you
who
belong
to
all
have
become
mine
for
fear
of
lose
you
I
hold
you
tight
to
my
breast
what
magic
have
snare
the
world
treasure
in
this
slend
arm
of
mine
the
boat
I
must
launch
out
my
boat
the
languid
hour
pass
by
on
the
shore
alas
for
I
the
spring
have
do
its
flowering
and
take
leave
and
now
with
the
burden
of
fade
futile
flower
I
wait
and
linger
the
wave
have
become
clamorous
and
upon
the
bank
in
the
shady
lane
the
yellow
leave
flutter
and
fall
what
emptiness
do
you
gaze
upon
do
you
not
feel
a
thrill
pass
through
the
air
with
the
note
of
the
far
away
song
float
from
the
other
shore
the
chanpa
flower
suppose
I
become
a
chanpa
flower
just
for
fun
and
grow
on
a
branch
high
up
that
tree
and
shake
in
the
wind
with
laughter
and
dance
upon
the
newly
bud
leave
would
you
know
I
mother
you
would
call
baby
where
be
you
and
I
should
laugh
to
myself
and
keep
quite
quiet
I
should
slyly
open
my
petal
and
watch
you
at
you
work
when
after
you
bath
with
wet
hair
spread
on
you
shoulder
you
walk
through
the
shadow
of
the
champ
tree
to
the
little
court
where
you
say
you
prayer
you
would
notice
the
scent
of
the
flower
but
not
know
that
it
cane
from
I
when
after
the
midday
meal
you
sit
at
the
window
reading
Ramayana
and
the
tree
shadow
fall
over
you
hair
and
you
lap
I
should
fling
my
wee
little
shadow
on
to
the
page
of
you
book
just
where
you
be
read
but
would
you
guess
that
it
be
the
tiny
shadow
of
you
little
child
when
in
the
evening
you
go
to
the
cow
shed
with
the
light
lamp
in
you
hand
I
should
suddenly
drop
on
to
the
earth
again
and
be
you
own
baby
once
more
and
beg
you
to
tell
I
a
story
where
have
you
be
you
naughty
child
I
will
not
tell
you
mother
that
be
what
you
and
I
would
say
then
the
child
angel
they
clamour
and
fight
they
doubt
and
despair
they
know
no
end
to
they
wrangling
let
you
life
come
amongst
they
like
a
flame
of
light
my
child
unflickering
and
pure
and
delight
they
into
silence
they
be
cruel
in
they
greed
and
they
envy
they
word
be
like
hide
knife
thirst
for
blood
go
and
stand
amidst
they
scowl
heart
my
child
and
let
you
gentle
eye
fall
upon
they
like
the
forgiving
peace
of
the
evening
over
the
strife
of
the
day
let
they
see
you
face
my
child
and
thus
know
the
meaning
of
all
thing
let
they
love
you
and
thus
love
each
other
come
and
take
you
seat
in
the
bosom
of
the
limitless
my
child
at
sunrise
open
and
raise
you
heart
like
a
blossoming
flower
and
at
sunset
bend
you
head
and
in
silence
complete
the
worship
of
the
day
the
end
it
be
time
for
I
to
go
mother
I
be
go
when
in
the
paling
darkness
of
the
lonely
dawn
you
stretch
out
you
arm
for
you
baby
in
the
bed
I
shall
say
baby
be
not
here
mother
I
be
go
I
shall
become
a
delicate
draught
of
air
and
caress
you
and
I
shall
be
ripple
in
the
water
when
you
bathe
and
kiss
you
and
kiss
you
again
in
the
gusty
night
when
the
rain
patter
on
the
leave
you
will
hear
my
whisper
in
you
bed
and
my
laughter
will
flash
with
the
lightning
through
the
open
window
into
you
room
if
you
lie
awake
think
of
you
baby
till
late
into
the
night
I
shall
sing
to
you
from
the
star
sleep
mother
sleep
one
the
stray
moonbeam
I
shall
steal
over
you
bed
and
lie
upon
you
bosom
while
you
sleep
I
shall
become
a
dream
and
through
the
little
opening
of
you
eyelid
I
shall
slip
into
the
depth
of
you
sleep
and
when
you
wake
up
and
look
round
startle
like
a
twinkle
firefly
I
shall
flit
out
into
the
darkness
when
on
the
great
festival
of
puja
the
neighbour
child
come
and
play
about
the
house
I
shall
melt
into
the
music
of
the
flute
and
throb
in
you
heart
all
day
dear
auntie
will
come
with
puja
present
and
will
ask
where
be
we
baby
sister
mother

will
tell
she
softly

be
in
the
pupil
of
my
eye
he
be
in
my
body
and
in
my
soul
the
first
jasmine
ah
this
jasmine
this
white
jasmine
I
seem
to
remember
the
first
day
when
I
fill
my
hand
with
this
jasmine
this
white
jasmine
I
have
love
the
sunlight
the
sky
and
the
green
earth
I
have
hear
the
liquid
murmur
of
the
river
thorough
the
darkness
of
midnight
autumn
sunset
have
come
to
I
at
the
bend
of
a
road
in
the
lonely
waste
like
a
bride
raise
she
veil
to
accept
she
lover
yet
my
memory
be
still
sweet
with
the
first
white
jasmine
that
I
hold
in
my
hand
when
I
be
a
child
many
a
glad
day
have
come
in
my
life
and
I
have
laugh
with
merrymaker
on
festival
night
on
grey
morning
of
rain
I
have
croon
many
a
idle
song
I
have
wear
round
my
neck
the
evening
wreath
of
bakulas
wove
by
the
hand
of
love
yet
my
heart
be
sweet
with
the
memory
of
the
first
fresh
jasmine
that
fill
my
hand
when
I
be
a
child
the
flower
school
when
storm
cloud
rumble
in
the
sky
and
June
shower
come
down
the
moist
east
wind
come
march
over
the
heath
to
blow
its
bagpip
among
the
bamboo
then
crowd
of
flower
come
out
of
a
sudden
from
nobody
know
where
and
dance
upon
the
grass
in
wild
glee
mother
I
really
think
the
flower
go
to
school
underground
they
do
they
lesson
with
door
shut
and
if
they
want
to
come
out
to
play
before
it
be
time
they
master
make
they
stand
in
a
corner
when
the
rain
come
they
have
they
holiday
branch
clash
together
in
the
forest
and
the
leave
rustle
in
the
wild
wind
the
thunder
cloud
clap
they
giant
hand
and
the
flower
child
rush
out
in
dress
of
pink
and
yellow
and
white
do
you
know
mother
they
home
be
in
the

know
why
they

in
such
a

of

guess
to
whom
they

they
arm
they
have
they

you

you
leave

I
should
mourn
for

and
set
you
solitary
image
in

in
a
golden
song

ah
my
evil
fortune

die
for

and
the

warn
I
that
life
be
but
a

on

should
I
neglect
all
this
to

after

who
have
turn

it
wise
to
break
one
heart
for
the
one
who
take
she
heart
away
for

be
short
it
be
sweet
to
sit
in
a
corner
to
muse
and
write
in
rhyme
that
you
be
all
my
world
it
be
heroic
to
hug
one
sorrow
and
determine
not
to
be
consol
but
a
fresh
face
peep
across
my

and
raise
its
eye
to
my

I
cannot

wipe
away
my

ever
silent
we
do
not
raise
we
hand
to
the
void
for

beyond
hope
it
be
enough
what
we
give
and
we
get
we
have
not
crush
the
joy
to
the

to
wring
from
it
the
wine
of

with

hero
mother
let
we
imagine
we
be
travel
and
pass
through
a
strange
and
dangerous
country
you
be
ride
in
a
palanquin
and
I
be
trot
by
you
on
a
red
horse
it
be
evening
and
the
sun
go
down
the
waste
of

wan
and
grey
before
we
the
land
be
desolate
and
barren

be
frighten
and
think
I
know
not
where
we
have
come
to
I
say
to
you
mother
do
not
be
afraid
the
meadow
be
prickly
with
spiky
grass
and
through
it
run
a
narrow
break
path
there
be
no
cattle
to
be
see
in
the
wide
field
they
have
go
to
they
village
stall
it
grow
dark
and
dim
on
the
land
and
sky
and
we
cannot
tell
where
we
be
go
suddenly
you
call
I
and
ask
I
in
a
whisper
what
light
be
that
near
the
bank
just
then
there
burst
out
a
fearful
yell
and
figure
come
run
towards
we
you
sit
crouch
in
you
palanquin
and
repeat
the
name
of
the
god
in
prayer
the
bearer
shake
in
terror
hide
themselves
in
the
thorny
bush
I
shout
to
you
do
not
be
afraid
mother
I
be
here
with
long
stick
in
they
hand
and
hair
all
wild
about
they
head
they
come
near
and
near
I
shout
have
a
care
you
villain
one
step
more
and
you
be
dead
man
they
give
another
terrible
yell
and
rush
forward
you
clutch
my
hand
and
say
dear
boy
for
heaven
sake
keep
away
from
they
I
say
mother
just
you
watch
I
then
I
spur
my
horse
for
a
wild
gallop
and
my
sword
and
buckler
clash
against
each
other
the
fight
become
so
fearful
mother
that
it
would
give
you
a
cold
shudder
could
you
see
it
from
you
palanquin
many
of
they
fly
and
a
great
number
be
cut
to
piece
I
know
you
be
think
sit
all
by
yourself
that
you
boy
must
be
dead
by
this
time
but
I
come
to
you
all
stain
with
blood
and
say
mother
the
fight
be
over
now
you
come
out
and
kiss
I
press
I
to
you
heart
and
you
say
to
yourself
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
if
I
have
not
my
boy
to
escort
I
a
thousand
useless
thing
happen
day
after
day
and
why
could
not
such
a
thing
come
true
by
chance
it
would
be
like
a
story
in
a
book
my
brother
would
say
be
it
possible
I
always
think
he
be
so
delicate
we
village
people
would
all
say
in
amazement
be
it
not
lucky
that
the
boy
be
with
he
mother
the
journey
the
morning
sea
of
silence
break
into
ripple
of
bird
song
and
the
flower
be
all
merry
by
the
roadside
and
the
wealth
of
gold
be
scatter
through
the
rift
of
the
cloud
while
we
busily
go
on
we
way
and
pay
no
heed
we
sing
no
glad
song
nor
play
we
go
not
to
the
village
for
barter
we
speak
not
a
word
nor
smile
we
linger
not
on
the
way
we
quicken
we
pace
more
and
more
as
the
time
sped
by
the
sun
rise
to
the
midmorning
sky
and
dove
coo
in
the
shade
wither
leave
dance
and
whirl
in
the
hot
air
of
noon
the
shepherd
boy
drowse
and
dream
in
the
shadow
of
the
banyan
tree
and
I
lay
myself
down
by
the
water
and
stretch
my
tired
limb
on
the
grass
my
companion
laugh
at
I
in
scorn
they
hold
they
head
high
and
hurry
on
they
never
look
back
nor
rest
they
vanish
in
the
distant
blue
haze
they
cross
many
meadow
and
hill
and
pass
through
strange
far
away
country
all
honor
to
you
heroic
host
of
the
interminable
path
mockery
and
reproach
prick
I
to
rise
but
find
no
response
in
I
I
give
myself
up
for
lose
in
the
depth
of
a
glad
humiliation
in
the
shadow
of
a
dim
delight
the
repose
of
the
green
gloom
slowly
spread
over
my
heart
I
forget
for
what
I
have
travel
and
I
surrender
my
mind
without
struggle
to
the
maze
of
shadow
and
song
at
last
when
I
wake
from
my
slumber
and
open
my
eye
I
see
thee
standing
by
I
flood
my
sleep
with
thy
smile
how
I
have
fear
that
the
path
be
long
and
wearisome
and
the
struggle
to
reach
thee
be
hard
the
judge
say
of
he
what
you
please
but
I
know
my
child
failing
I
do
not
love
he
because
he
be
good
but
because
he
be
my
little
child
how
should
you
know
how
dear
he
can
be
when
you
try
to
weigh
he
merit
against
he
fault
when
I
must
punish
he
he
become
all
the
more
a

vast
mystery
like

at

its
consolation

edge
of

field
and

old
fisher
woman

gather
herb
for
she
supper
by
the
side
of

shadow
be
grow
dark
under
the
madar
tree
and
the
water
in
the
pond
look
shiny
black
if
twelve

no
more
noisy

the
speech
of

on
in
murmuring
of
a
song
man
hasten
to
the
king
market
all
the
buyer
and
seller
be
there
but
I
have
my
untimely
leave
in
the
middle
of
the
day
in
the
thick
of
work
let
then
the
flower
come
out
in
my
garden
though
it
be
not
they
time
and
let
the
midday
bee
strike
up
they
lazy
hum
full
many
a
hour
have
I
spend
in
the
strife
of
the
good
and
the
evil
but
now
it
be
the
pleasure
of
my
playmate
of
the
empty
day
to
draw
my
heart
on
to
he
and
I
know
not
why
be
this
sudden
call
to
what
useless
inconsequence
vocation
when
the
gong
sound

in
the
morning
and
I
walk
to
school
by
we
lane
every
day
I
meet
the
hawker
cry
bangle
crystal
bangle
there
be
nothing
to
hurry
he
on
there
be
no
road
he
must
take
no
place
he
must
go
to
no
time
when
he
must
come
home
I
wish
I
be
a
hawker
spend
my
day
in
the
road
cry
bangle
crystal
bangle
when
at
four
in
the
afternoon
I
come
back
from
the
school
I
can
see
through
the
gate
of
that
house
the
gardener
dig
the
ground
he
do
what
he
like
with
he
spade
he
soil
he
clothes
with
dust
nobody
take
he
to
task
if
he
get
bake
in
the
sun
or
get
wet
I
wish
I
be
a
gardener
dig
away
at
the
garden
with
nobody
to
stop
I
from
dig
just
as
it
get
dark
in
the
evening
and
my
mother
send
I
to
bed
I
can
see
through
my
open
window
the
watchman
walk
up
and
down
the
lane
be
dark
and
lonely
and
the
street
lamp
stand
like
a
giant
with
one
red
eye
in
its
head
the
watchman
swing
he
lantern
and
walk
with
he
shadow
at
he
side
and
never
once
go
to
bed
in
he
life
I
wish
I
be
a
watchman
walk
the
street
all
night
chase
the
shadow
with
my
lantern
when
and
why
when
I
bring
you
coloured
toy
my
child
I
understand
why
there
be
such
a
play
of
colour
on
cloud
on
water
and
why
flower
be
paint
in
tint
when
I
give
coloured
toy
to
you
my
child
when
I
sing
to
make
you
dance
I
truly
know
why
there
be
music
in
leave
and
why
wave
send
they
chorus
of
voice
to
the
heart
of
the
listening
earth
when
I
sing
to
make
you
dance
when
I
bring
sweet
thing
to
you
greedy
hand
I
know
why
there
be
honey
in
the
cup
of
the
flower
and
why
fruit
be
secretly
fill
with
sweet
juice
when
I
bring
sweet
thing
to
you
greedy
hand
when
I
kiss
you
face
to
make
you
smile
my
darling
I
surely
understand
what
pleasure
stream
from
the
sky
in
morning
light
and
what
delight
the
summer
breeze
bring
to
my
body
when
I
kiss
you
to
make
you
smile
when
day
be
do
if
the
day
be
do
if
bird
sing
no
more
if
the
wind
have
flag
tired
then
draw
the
veil
of
darkness
thick
upon
I
even
as
thou
hast
wrapt
the
earth
with
the
coverlet
of
sleep
and
tenderly
close
the
petal
of
the
droop
lotus
at
dusk
we
meeting
two
of
we
once
meet
where
the
stream
of
life
and
death
have
stop
where
time
stand
still
today
it
be
so
far
and
away
now
I
be
sail
alone
my
boat
be
rock
in
the
storm
I
now
remember
again
how
once
we
meet
at
the
end
of
the
world
where
have
descend
the
heaven
forget
all
we
sit
there
side
by
side
that
day
I
realize
what
sway
the
blade
of
grass
throughout
the
world
in
what
delight
everything
shiver
in
the
dark
how
shine
star
in
what
great
urge
the
breath
of
life
rush
that
day
I
realize
when
we
wake
up
and
look
at
each
other
face
take
you
hand
in
my
hand
I
keep
look
at
the
sky
we
have
no
word
and
do
not
know
how
we
time
pass
that
day
I
have
realize
in
my
heart
of
heart
where
end
the
meaning
of
we
word
how
music
rise
from
the
core
of
the
universe
how
the
pine
wood
blossom
into
flower
this
we
realize
when
both
of
we
geep
in
endless
pleasure
then
we
come
to
know
in
what
fire
silently
burn
the
wind
of
spring
why
the
morning
sun
yearn
to
get
lose
in
everything
why
day
and
night
the
river
run
to
meet
the
sea
why
the
lightning
be
hurt
by
its
own
light
what
game
the
night
play
with
dawn
accept
defeat
all
this
we
realize
when
with
each
other
we
play
stake
we
everything
see
more
at
unending

when

I

that

I
do
not

in
the
stream
of
death
I
be

I
be
desireless
I
be
peace
I
be
illumined
he
I

at
the
golden

I
sit
on

and

the

be
swollen
and
fierce
in
its
flow
as
we
cut
the

to

one
small
paddy
field
no
one
but
I
flood
water
twist
and
swirl
everywhere
tree
on
the
far

smear
shadow
like

on
a

on

morning
grey
on
this
side
a
paddy
field
no

but
I
who
be
this
steering
close
to

I
feel
that
she
be
someone
I
know
the

be
fill
wide
she
gaze
ahead
wave
break
helplessly
against
the
boat
each
side
I
watch
and
feel
I
have
see
she
face
before
oh
to
what
foreign
land
do
you
sail
come
to
the
bank
and
moor
you
boat
for
a
while
go
where
you
want
to
give
where
you
care
to
but
come
to
the
bank
a
moment
show
you
smile
take
away
my
golden
paddy
when
you
sail
take
it
take
as
much
as
you
can
load
be
there
more
no
none
I
have
put
it
aboard
my
intense
labour
here
by
the

I

now
take
I
as

take
I
aboard
no

no

full
across
the

cloud
heave
to
and
for
on
the
bare
river
bank
I
remain
alone
what
have
have
go
the
golden

take
all
at
the
last
watch
pity
in
place
of
love
that
pettiest
of
gift
be
but
a
sugar
coating
over
neglect
any
passerby
can
make
a
gift
of
it
to
a
street
beggar
only
to
forget
the
moment
the
first
corner
be
turn
I
have
not
hope
for
anything
more
that
day
you
leave
during
the
last
watch
of
night
I
have
hope
you
would
say
goodbye
just
say
adieu
before
go
away
what
you
have
say
another
day
what
I
shall
never
hear
again
in
they
place
just
that
one
word
bind
by
the
thin
fabric
of
a
little
compassion
would
even
that
have
be
too
much
for
you
to
bear
when
I
first
awoke
from
sleep
my
heart
flutter
with
fear
lest
the
time
have
be
over
I
rush
out
of
bed
the
distant
church
clock
chime
half
past
twelve
I
sit
wait
near
the
door
of
my
room
rest
my
head
against
it
face
the
porch
through
which
you
would
come
out
even
that
tiny
of
chance
be
snatch
away
by
fate
from
hapless
I
I
fall
asleep
shortly
before
you
leave
perhaps
you
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
my
recline
body
like
a
break
boat
leave
high
and
dry
perhaps
you
walk
away
with
care
lest
you
wake
I
up
awake
with
a
start
I
know
at
once
that
my
vigil
have
be
waste
I
realise
what
be
to
go
go
away
in
a
moment
what
be
to
stay
behind
stay
on
for
all
time
silence
everywhere
like
that
of
a
bird
nest
bereft
of
bird
on
the
bough
of
a
songless
tree
with
the
lifeless
light
of
the
wane
moon
be
now
blend
the
pallor
of
dawn
spread
itself
over
the
greyness
of
my
empty
life
I
walk
towards
you
bedroom
for
no
reason
outside
the
door
burn
a
smoky
lantern
cover
with
soot
the
porch
smelt
of
the
smoulder
wick
over
the
abandon
bed
the
flap
of
the
roll
up
mosquito
net
flutter
a
little
in
the
breeze
see
in
the
sky
outside
through
the
window
be
the
morning
star
witness
of
all
sleepless
people
bereft
of
hope
suddenly
I
find
you
have
leave
behind
by
mistake
you
gold
mount
ivory
walking
stick
if
there
be
time
I
think
you
might
come
back
from
the
station
to
look
for
it
but
not
because
you
have
not
see
I
before
go
away
the
gardener
xxix
speak
to
I
my

to
I
my

in

what
you
sing
the
night
be
dark
the
star
be
lose
in
cloud
the
wind
be
sigh
through
the
leave
I
will
let
lose
my
hair
my
blue
cloak
will
cling
round
I
like
night
I
will
clasp
you
head
to
my
bosom
and
there
in
the
sweet
loneliness
murmur
on
you
heart
I
will
shut
my
eye
and
listen
I
will
not
look
in
you
face
when
you
word
be

we
will
sit
still
and
silent
only
the
tree
will
whisper
in
the
dark
the
night
will
pale
the
day
will
dawn
we
shall
look
at
each
other
eye
and
go
on

I
in
word
what
you
sing
paper
boat
day
by

I
float
my
paper
boat
one
by
one
down
the
running
stream
in
big
black
letter
I
write
my
name
on
they
and
the
name
of
the
village
where
I
live
I
hope
that
someone
in
some
strange
land
will
find
they
and
know
who
I
be
I
load
my
little
boat
with
shiuli
flower
from
we
garden
and
hope
that
this
bloom
of
the
dawn
will
be
carry
safely
to
land
in
the
night
I
launch
my
paper
boat
and
look
up
into
the
sky
and
see
the
little
cloud
set
thee
white
bulg
sail
I
know
not
what
playmate
of
mine
in
the
sky
send
they
down
the
air
to
race
with
my
boat
when
night
come
I
bury
my
face
in
my
arm
and
dream
that
my
paper
boat
float
on
and
on
under
the
midnight
star
the
fairy
of
sleep
be
sail
in
they
and
the
lading
be
they
basket
full
of
dream
I
I
wonder
if
I
know
he
in
whose
speech
be
my
voice
in
whose
movement
be
my
being
whose
skill
be
in
my
line
whose
melody
be
in
my
song
in
joy
and
sorrow
I
think
he
be
chain
within
I
contain
by
tear
and
laughter
work
and
play
I
think
he
be
my
very
self
come
to
a
end
with
my
death
why
then
in
a
flood
of
joy
do
I
feel
he
in
the
sight
and
touch
of
my
beloved
this
I
beyond
self
I
find
on
the
shore
of
the
shine
sea
therefore
I
know
this
I
be
not
imprison
within
my
bound
lose
myself
I
find
he
beyond
the
border
of
time
and
space
through
the
age
I
come
to
know
he
shine
self
in
the
life
of
the
seeker
in
the
voice
of
the
poet
from
the
dark
cloud

many

so

countless
birth
and

to
the
pattern
of
oh

and
get
out
a
witness
to
tear
and
uproar
a
witness
to
hurtful
word
and
slamming

a

anytime
I
walk
out

all
that
matter
be
the
story
my
friend
the
one
with
a
strong
beginning
unclear
middle
but
no
end
it
be
a
screw
up
world
even
a
blind
man
could
see
that
to
fake
happiness
you
have
to
be
who
other
expect
you
to

I
do
not
understand
how
be
you

completely
break
do
you
miss
I
the
way
I
wish

seem
to
mean

be
be
a

unanswered
phone
call
and
the
time
that

not
happy
from
the
time
I
walk
in
the
door
till
the
time
I
go
to

every
night
the
scream
never

I
pray
for

to
stop
to
go
away
but
will

so
I
can
stop
this
same
old
prayer
maybe
then
it
will
not
be
so
hard
to
breathe
maybe
then
life
will
seem
fair
thought
of

dream
that
haunt
I
every
night
be
about
one
thing
she
and
the
time
that
I
regret

make
I
realize
I
have
no
trust
not
even
for
myself

make
I
forget
the
feeling
of
lust
so
I
want
to
thank

she
be
such
a
weirdo
yet
you
super
hero
I
may
be
another
girl
you
look
at
and
walk
away
from
interested
in
hip
hop
dance
and
track
this
world
be
full
of
uncaring
inconsiderate
asshole
and
do
with
have
to
deal
with
they
be
like
to
direct
myself
to
path
ie
wish
to
take
clingy
and
friendly
but
not
ready
for
relationship
stuff
ie
be
hurt
many
time
by
people
I
think
be
good
friend
and
still
heal
from
that
bad
memory
I
believe
no
one
have
the
authority
to
say
judgmental
or
nasty
comment
to
another
person
it
be
quite
immature
I
do
not
expect
everyone
to
like
I
that
be
just
life
live
to
do
it
right
not
just
have
fun
I
do
not
drink
smoke
or
take
drug
mainly
because
I
respect
my
body
that
be
my
choice
not
the
pretty
or
smart
girl
but
I
have
a
perfect
family
and
great
friend
who
love
I
for
who
I
be
and
give
I
great
advice
I
admit
not
perfect
but
I
try
my
good
life
be
unexpected
but
it
be
the
people
around
you
who
make
it
expect
it
hurt
I
it
hurt
I
to
hear
you
cry
it
hurt
I
that
you
have
thought
of
die
I
know
you
need
a
friend
so
will
be
with
you
till
the
very
end
be
with
you
through
thick
and
thin
and
this
fight
I
promise
we
will
win
I
hope
you
know
always
be
there
you
no
long
have
to
live
in
despair
I
just
want
you
to
know
the
love
that
I
have
to
show
the
silent
girl

in
the
classroom
proud
and
strong
she
talk
like
she
be
be
good
all
along
she
smile
and
wave
and
look
happy
but
deep
down
inside
she
be
anything
but
proud
and
snappy
she
have
cut
on
she
arm
and
bruise
near
she
eye
but
that
be
all
she
need
to
be
satisfied
when
she
be
at
home
she
feel
so
alone
she
lose
so
many
love
all
of
the
above
a
abusive
life
and
feel
like
no
one
care
beat
torture
and
break
inside
all
she
ever
do
be
run
and
hide
for
something
that
be
to
hard
to
describe
all
she
ever
need

he
must
suppress
he
tear
to
balance
this
life
and
control
yet
during
that
rare
and
supreme
happy
moment
of
life
tear
be
see
to
well
up
in
we
eye
laughter
get
mingle
with
we
tear
I
wonder
why
perhaps
laughter
and
tear
be
two
side
of
the
same
coin
of
we
worldly
life
while
we
lacrymal
gland
perform
this
feat
as
laughter
and
tear
join
hand
to
make
this
life
complete
iii
while
hearty
and
connect
laughter
do
provide
physiological
psychological
and
spiritual
benefit
on
hindsight
laughter
bring
a
twinkle
in
we
eye
destroy
we
conservative
reputation
improve
we
cardiovascular
flexibility
increase
we
spiritual
quotient
laughter
like
internal
jogging
give
we
a
internal
massaging
perform
both
silently
and
rapidly
beyond
imagine
revitalize
that
unexplored
internal
cranny
all
automatic
far
good
than
all
we
know
antibiotic
laughter
a
tranquilizer
without
side
effect
release
we
pent
up
tension
relax
we
instead
iv
a
optimist
always
laugh
to
forget
while
a
pessimist
forget
to
laugh
my
man
in
the
park
be
perhaps
a
optimist
who
have
embrace
this
therapy
as
a
art
or
perhaps
that
man
laugh
daily
at
the
frailty
of
a
meaningless
life
in
this
life
of
absurdity
as
he
adapt
himself
to
survive
this
laughter
therapy
be
a
tranquilizer
both
healthy
and
free
perhaps
that
man
in
the
park
be
laugh
at
both
you
and
I
we
life
become
a
tragedy
for
that
who
only
feel
but
a
comedy
of
laughter
if
you
pause
a
while
to
think
so
let
we
try
to
make
other
laugh
while
we
try
to
control
we
tear
laugh
be
a
healing
process
and
drive
away
we
fear
let
we
make
a
new
year
resolution
make
laughter
we
altruistic
mission
couple
with
a
loving
and
caring
heart
all
true
let
this
laughter
as
a
therapy
benefit
both

the
house
with
nobody
in
it
a
poem
by
joyce
kilmer
whenever
I
walk
to
suffern
along
the
erie
track
I
go
by
a
poor
old
farmhouse
with
its
shingle
break
and
black
I
suppose
pass
it
a
hundred
time
but
I
always
stop
for
a
minute
and
look
at
the
house
the
tragic
house
the
house
with
nobody
in
it
I
never
have
see
a
haunt
house
but
I
hear
there
be
such
thing
that
they
hold
the
talk
of
spirit
they
mirth
and
sorrowing
I
know
this
house
be
not
haunt
and
I
wish
it
be
I
do
for
it
would
not
be
so
lonely
if
it
have
a
ghost
or
two
this
house
on
the
road
to
suffern
need
a
dozen
pane
of
glass
and
somebody
ought
to
weed
the
walk
and
take
a
scythe
to
the
grass
it
need
new
paint
and
shingle
and
the
vine
should
be
trim
and
tie
but
what
it
need
the
most
of
all
be
some
people
live
inside
if
I
have
a
lot
of
money
and
all
my
debt
be
pay
put
a
gang
of
man
to
work
with
brush
and
see
and
spade
buy
that
place
and
fix
it
up
the
way
it
use
to
be
and
find
some
people
who
want
a
home
and
give
it
to
they
free
now
a
new
house
stand
empty
with
stare
window
and
door
look
idle
perhaps
and
foolish
like
a
hat
on
its
block
in
the
store
but
there
be
nothing
mournful
about
it
it
can
not
be
sad
and
lone
for
the
lack
of
something
within
it
that
it
have
never
know
but
a
house
that
have
do
what
a
house
should
do
a
house
that
have
shelter
life
that
have
put
its
loving
wooden
arm
around
a
man
and
he
wife
a
house
that
have
echo
a
baby
laugh
and
hold
up
he
stumble
foot
be
the
sad
sight
when
it
be
leave
alone
that
ever
you
eye
could
meet
so
whenever
I
go
to
suffern
along
the
erie
track
I
never
go
by
the
empty
house
without
stop
and
look
back
yet
it
hurt
I
to
look
at
the
crumble
roof
and
the
shutter
fall
apart
for
I
help
think
the
poor
old
house
be
a
house
with
a
break
heart
darkness
a
poem
by
lord
byron
I
have
a
dream
which
be
not
all
a
dream
the
bright
sun
be
and
the
star
do
wander
darkling
in
the
eternal
space
rayless
and
pathless
and
the
icy
earth
swing
blind
and
blacken
in
the
moonless
air
morn
come
and
go
and
come
and
bring
no
day
and
man
forget
they
passion
in
the
dread
of
this
desolation
and
all
heart
be
into
a
selfish
prayer
for
light
and
they
do
live
by
watchfire
and
the
throne
the
palace
of
crown
king
the
hut
the
habitation
of
all
thing
which
dwell
be
burn
for
beacon
city
be
consume
and
man
be
gather
round
they
blaze
home
to
look
once
more
into
each
other
face
happy
be
that
who
dwelt
within
the
eye
of
the
volcano
and
they
mountain
torch
a
fearful
hope
be
all
the
world
contain
forest
be
set
on
fire
but
hour
by
hour
they
fall
and
fade
and
the
crackle
trunk
extinguish
with
a
crash
and
all
be
black
the
brow
of
man
by
the
despairing
light
wear
a
unearthly
aspect
as
by
fit
the
flash
fall
upon
they
some
lay
down
and
hide
they
eye
and
geep
and
some
do
rest
they
chin
upon
they
clench
hand
and
smile
and
other
hurry
to
and
for
and
feed
they
funeral
pile
with
fuel
and
look
up
with
mad
disquietude
on
the
dull
sky
the
pall
of
a
past
world
and
then
again
with
curse
cast
they
down
upon
the
dust
and
gnash
they
tooth
and
howl
would
the
wild
bird
shriek
and
terrified
do
flutter
on
the
ground
and
flap
they
useless
wing
the
wild
brute
come
tame
and
tremolous
and
viper
crawl
and
twin
themselves
among
the
multitude
hiss
but
stingless
they
be
slain
for
food
and
war
which
for
a
moment
be
no
more
do
glut
himself
again
a
meal
be
buy
with
blood
and
each
sate
sullenly
apart
gorge
himself
in
gloom
no
love
be
leave
all
earth
be
but
one
thought
and
that
be
death
immediate
and
inglorious
and
the
pang
of
famine
feed
upon
all
entrail
man
die
and
they
bone
be
tombless
as
they
flesh
the
meagre
by
the
meagre
be
devour
even
dog
assail
they
master
all
save
one
and
he
be
faithful
to
a
corpse
and
keep
the
bird
and

and
man
at
bay
till

they
or
the
drop

they
lank

seek
out
no

but
with
a
piteous
and
perpetual
moan
and
a
quick
desolate
cry
lick
the
hand
which
answer
not
with
a
caress
he
die
the
crowd
be
by
degree
but
two
of
a
enormous
city
do
survive
and
they
be
enemy
they
meet
beside
the
die
ember
of
a
altar
place
where
have
be
heap
a
mass
of
holy
thing
for
a
unholy
usage
they
rake
up
and
shiver
scrape
with
they
cold
skeleton
hand
the
feeble
ash
and
they
feeble
breath
blow
for
a
little
life
and
make
a
flame
wich
be
a
mockery
then
they
lift
up
they
eye
as
it
grow
light
and
each
other
aspect
see
and
and
die
beheld
even
of
they
mutual
hideousness
they
die
unknow
who
he
be
upon
whose
brow
famine
have
write
fiend
the
world
be
void
the
populous
and
the
powerful
be
a
lump
seasonless
herbless
treeless
manless
lifeless
a
lump
of
death
a
chaos
of
hard
clay
the
river
lake
and
ocean
stand
still
and
nothing
stir
within
they
silent
depth
ship
sailorless
lay
rot
on
the
sea
and
they
mast
fall
down
piecemeal
as
they
drop
they
sleep
on
the
abyss
without
a
surge
the
wave
be
dead
the
tide
be
in
they
grave
the
moon
they
mistress
have
expire
before
the

in
the
stagnant

have
no
need
of

from
they
she
be
the
universe
as
soft
wind
sweep
away
the
day
I
look
back
on
life
through
a
haze
remember
playground
park
and
friend
in
childlike
gaze
that
never
end
the
laughter
in
a
game
of
catch

be
for
loser
and
airy
fairy
bard
to
put
a
pen
to
paper
and
write
about
you
life
have
enough
of
all
of
that
they
only
cause
I
strife
free

be
awful
for
fool
without

repetition
be
far
too
simple
just
repeat

that
lovey
dovey

that
wishy

crap
and
poem
about
hatred
you
all

I
all
you
rambling
I
do
not
care
how
you
feel
you
self
expression
surely
stink
of
mouldy
day
old
eel
to
tell
a
tale
of
wonder
never
cease
to
be
trite
to
sing
of
magic
wonder
be
nothing
but
pure
you
metaphor
be
useless
you
imagery
be
vile
you
sense
of
diction
make
I
gag
I
cannot
stand
you
style
so
save
I
you
quotation
please
spare
I
all
you
rhyme
shove
that
poem
up
you
rear
and
cease
to
waste
my
time
I
look
at
what
ie
write
this
jumble
of
cliché
look
like
I
write
a
bloody
poem
so
the
one
to
blame
this
will
be
the
last
time
I
currently
drown
in
a
black
sea
of
a
swirl
abyss
as
you
mould
I
to
how
you
see
fit
to
how
you
wish
I
to
be
you
can
not
hear
it
but
scream
on
the
inside
it
be
be
day
but
feel
like
it
be
be
year
become
use
to
so
much
torture
that
my
lace
fring
heart
stop
breathe
now
the
empty
shell
of
a
woman
only
remain
but
you
be
pleased
with
what
you
have
do
as
you
marvel
at
the
girl
you
destroy
now
once
that
coppery
sun
have
set
I
shall
seek
my
deserving
revenge
with
all
the
hurt
and
anger
I
have
bottled
up
you
will
not
make
it
out
alive
you
can
count
on
that
darling
the
last
thing
you
will
see
will
be
my
charcoal
eye
and
the
psychotic
harlequin
smile
I
don
be
sure
that
I
will
rip
out
you
ugly
heart
with
my
bare
hand
stain
and
tarnish
they
porcelain
finish
this
will
be
the
last
I
waste
my
time
on
you
with
hug
and
love
always
sorry
my
mask
fall
what
emotion
be
I
wear
since
the
day
I
be
bear
humanity
always
hate
I
anytime
I
accomplish
something
the
critic
always
slate
for
free
speak
of
this
weak
flow
and
of
each
illiterate
rhyme
always
hear
last
in
show
so
I
retain
every
word
of
mine
but
look
at
I
now
every
rhyme
will
be
sublime
and
this
flow
of
corrupt
power
run
the
show
so
now
they
call
it
another
crime
to
express
the
feeling
I
do
not
know
to
write
emotion
in
life
spare
time
and
for
each
new
critic
who
try
to
dictate
another
tear
shed
emotion
slow
defens
shatter
break
I
let
go
wake
as
essence
tear
asuund
under
bright

mind
obscure
in
this
black
I
call
mine
mental
blacklist
entwine
with
physical
scar
lose
control
wait
for
god
loving
light
to
shine
step
forward
critic
rejoice
with
headlight
and
black
car
here
be
hate
prejudice
which
think
ill
of

and
there
be
love
prejudice
which
think
well
of
other
without
sufficient
warrant
it
be
you
choice
practice
hate
prejudice
or
try
god
way
with

prejudice
be
it
worth
the
argument
go
and
forget
rot
away
like
time
and
wear
I
become
frail
like
wilt
rose
yet
they
walk
on
by
without
a
care
and
no
one
even
suppose
another
page
another
turn
but
time
after
time
they
be
blank
and
then
my
edge
start
to
burn
in
place
of
where
my
heart
sink
I
sit
alone
and
decompose
simmer
out
like
a
die
light
and
despite
the
poetry
and
the
prose
I
slowly
lose
the
fight
now
just
a
pile
of
cinder
and
soot
I
be
sweep
to
a
corner
to
lay
sweep
by
society
heartless
foot
with
nothing
to
feel
and
nothing
to
say
slowly
over
time
I
start
to
disperse
and
blow
away
in
speck
of
black
and
in
this
lonely
pathetic
verse
it
be
too
late
for
you
to
take
it
back
the
inevitable
end
come
soon
than
expect
tell
I
one
reason
why
I
should
not
do
it
jump
from
this
building
or
tighten
this
noose
swallow
this
pill
or
cut
at
my
wrist
why
should
not
life
be
a
why
should
I
deal
or
try
to
get
by
when
all
that
I
get
be
for
I
to
cry
it
can
be
over
end
and
do
if
I
jump
or
I
can
be
hang
my
stomach
be
boil
with
the
vile
of
society
the
cause
for
this
bile
come
out
of
I
for
my
image
do
it
matter
though
we
all
look

to
the
guy
that
run
karaoke
and
I
would
not
be
watch
we
two
child
recreate
game
of
hopeful
daisy
chain
and
animal
cloud
and
if
we
have
choose
any
other
branch
good
enough
sarah
Mclachlan
after
one
of
the
life
from
any
other
branch
myself
some
call
I
be
crazy
some
say
I
be
sick
I
think
it
be
freedom
however
it
help
release
the
pain
that
I
go
through
every
day
feel
like
everything
be
wrong
I
want
to
escape
from
my
sadness
however
now
I
be
look
forward
I
no
long
feel
like
a
coward
any
challenge
put
before
I
to
stand
and
face
it
any
blessing
wait
for
I
to
try
and
take
it
although
almost
bring
tear
however
I
promise
never
cry
even
if
the
battle
seem
lose
never
die
although
adversity
be
long
humanity
strong
ourney
of
a
day
we
day
begin
with
sunrise
end
with
sunset
often
the
day
be
seem
useless
pointless
we
do
not
think
they
matter
but
they
do
everything
that
happen
have
a
reason
the
truth
will
be
reveal
in
due
season
we
life
be
a
journey
that
we
must
make
a
road
a
path
which
we
must
take
we
course
be
never
easy
the
stake
may
be
high
we
should
not
let
we
life
like
the
leave
in
winter
life
be
a
poem
where
we
write
we
story
everyday
life
be
a
game
which
we
must
play
through
trouble
and
disaster
we
never
know
what
we
will
get
we
hand
be
not
always
get
what
we
want
we
always
learn
a
lesson
of
heart
and
mind
be
teach
however
from
the
failure
we
should
not
walk
on
a
street
of
hopeless
blind
sometimes
we
find
the
face
with
in
the
face
which
hurt
we
most
of
the
time
still
we
always
expect
to
act
like
the
world
be
as
beautiful
and
clean
if
we
struggle
let
it
be
with
hope
for
thing
we
wish
to
see
so
in
every
day
let
we
find
you
know
the
world
for
its
reality
let
go
let
go
a
truth
so
bitter
let
go
a
wound
so
sore
for
nothing
in
life
be
permanent
and
change
be
the
only
constant
let
go
a
hide
drop
of
tear
let
go
a
secret
conceal
obscure
for
a
day
that
follow
the
night
without
remorse
from
a
grappling
dusk
to
a
delight
dawn
let
go
the
mask
that
cover
you
identity
let
go
the
shield
that
safeguard
you
dignity
because
you
be
the
betrayer
the
only
traitor
who
can
deceive
other
but
the
real
you
let
go
the
profound
pain
that
agonize
you
let
go
the
sinful
urge
that
torment
you
for
time
alone
be
the
good
healer
like
a
boon
to
mankind
in
disguise
let
go
the
evil
neighbor
you
let
go
the
devil
inside
of
you
you
overblown
ego
overstate
attitude
limitless
idiosyncrasy
eccentricity
let
go
you
fear
hurt
resentment
let
go
break
promise
hollow
commitment
for
life
be
too
petite
to
brood
over
insignificant
issue
like
grain
of
sand
wait
to
be
erode
with
ceaseless
time
let
we
pull
pull
the
boat
let
we
pull

from
the
water
safe
on
to

just

till

become
more
miserable
every

you
have
teach
she
to
believe
that
without

up
and

the
truth
without

finally
become
who

all
you
want
to
do
be
scream
please
god

I
it
a
dream
when
you
wake
in
the
morning
to
realize
its
reality
you
try
to
fight
the
finality
you
need
just
a
little
bit
of
normality
you
try
not
to
think
of
why
all
you
do
be
cry

try
to
be
angry
with
god
but
end
up
angry
at
yourself
why

just
stay
home
that
day
why
can
not
anything
ever
go
my
way
you
crawl
out
of
bed
decide
to
give
life
another
whirl
you
reach
out
some
reach
back
some
do
not
even
call
back
just
when
you
think
you
have
no
more
to
lose
you
do
this
people
you
think
to
be
friend
just
want
you
to
use
so

to
give
up
you
do
not

a
reason
any
long
to

wake
up
then
all
of
a
sudden
you
hear
the
sound
of
the
phone
ring
or
a
knock
on
the
door
someone
there
to
tell
you
not
to
give
up
you
be
worth
so
much
more
you
begin
to
cry
while
this
other
person
be
wonder
why
you
try
to
say
thank
you
for
be
my
friend
today
if
it
be
not
for
you
I
would
have
give
up
and
die
you
now
know
the
answer
of
why
it
be
to
remind
you
to
never

I
know
and
do

a
pleasant
sight
afraid
but
I
will
fight
no
boundary
free
my
mind
of

the
pressure

be
my
pleasure
I
want
so

see
I
use
to
be
a
fool
when
I
let
you
treat
I
cruel
I
make
a
mistake
but
I
go
let
my
self
break
leave
I
for
god
sake
so
now
I
kneel
down
to
pray
for
this
time
of
struggle
I
will
just
say
leave
in
you
hand
god
I
will
let
go
sometimes
sometimes
we
see
thing
that
be
not
mean
to
be
see
sometimes
thing
be
not
always
as
they
seem
sometimes
we
need
someone
to
call
we
own
especially
when
we
be
alone
sometimes
people
just
can
understand
why
thing
get
out
of
hand
sometimes
life
just
be
not
fair
especially
when
people
just
do
not
care
and
sometimes
it
hard
to
say
why
thing
have
to
be
this
way
sometimes
it
be
all
you
can
do
to
get
by
especially
when
dream
continue
to
die
sometimes
it
be
nice
to
sit
in
the
rain
even
to
just
relieve
the
pain
and
when
we
have
have
a
really
bad
day
sometimes
we
just
need
to
get
away
we
never
know
what
be
wrong
with
out
pain
sometimes
the
hard
thing
and
the
right
thing
be
the
same
and
sometimes
when
people
get
hurt
even
the
strong
one
may
need
comfort
have
courage
life
be
not
just
wake
up
one
morning
and
say
ok
I
want
this
to
happen
it
be
about
get
out
there
and
go
for
it

of
a
angel
and
prayer
from
my
heart
memory
memory
memory
I
have
have
some
be
good
though
most
be
bad
physical
and
sexual
abuse
occur
and
madness
and
sadness
reoccur
I
feel
as
though
on
display
as
carley
the
mess
up
school
girl
here
to
stay
but
they
will
never
know
how
I
will
grow
and
be
someone
some
day
so
look
at
I
in
dismay
and
you
discourage
I
for
the
last
time
today
life
will
go
on
when
I
be
little
my
life
be
great
but
as
I
get
old
I
and
my
mom
be
become
far
apart
my
mom
no
long
care
for
I
she
leave
I
alone
she
never
want
to
talk
or
give
kiss
and
hug
she
just
do
not
care
anymore
I
use
to
try
to
take
all
my
anger
out
on
myself
by
try
to
take
drug
and
drinking
but
now
I
realize
that
mom
do
not
care
and
she
never
will
so
try
to
become
something
great
something
not
like
she
I
hate
the
fact
that
she
be
not
around
but
I
have
learn
to
deal
with
it
if
she
do
not
want
to
be
with
I
why
should
I
want
to
be
with
she
I
have
learn
that
even
if
you
love
someone
they
might
not
feel
the
same
about
you
even
if
it
be
you
daughter
I
have
learn
to
deal
with
life
as
it
come
deal
with
it
the
good
you
can
and
do
not
let
other
people
control
you
life

long
as
you
let
it
life
be
hard

see
there
be
people
with

and
there
be

I
proud
to
see
every
day
there
be
more
trouble
for
I
to
carry
around
there
shooting
and
killing
and
gun
all
around
tired
of
wake
up
and
hear
one
of
my
people
be
down
black
and
hispanic
and
its
hard
to
get
around

not
pick

do
not
cause

something
tired
of

to
stand
tall
and
still
get
around
no
matter
how
much
hell

Christian
fool
hatred
toward
the
found
belief
official
lie
to
keep

seat
everything

would
be
outrageous
in
he
day
we
be
fine
with
drinking
and
drug
because
we
country
be
run
by
thug
we
want
to
take
the
rights
of
the
parent
to
somehow
protect
the
child
we
need
to
take
a
stand
to
stop
sin
in
this
Christian
found
land
all
of
we
forefather
break
law
be
a
good
enough
cause
to
rebel
against
the
come
evil
which
can
be
stop
at
will
we
just
need
to
take
a
stand
darkness
befall
glide
deep
into
the
forest
darkness
cover
I
like
a
blanket
and
the
mist
surround
I
I
feel
like
there
be
no
way
to
flee
I
look
beyond
the
broad
horizon
see
the
moon
shine
over
the
sea
like
the
ocean
fill
with
sadness
I
run
stumble
and
try
to
break
free
the
path
enclose
and
shattered
tear
of
rain
encumber
I
darkness
embrace
I
like
a
child
now
I
wait
for
he
to
let
I
be
my
one
true
life
one
true
story
tell
by
a
child
everyone
think
that
she
be
wild
but
it
be
she
cousin
who
exceed
the
truth
but
that
be
only
when
they
be
in
they
youth
all
grow
up
get
ready
to
go
bad
little
street
they
do
not
know
she
parent
think
she
be
a
lie
but
they
be
wrong
they
say
goodbye
runaway
just
like
a
slave
to
never
come
back
any
day
live
you
life
and
do
what
you
do
become
the
wife
that
you
want
to
get
a
job
just
be
you
because
by
the
end
of
the
day
that
be
only
thing
you
can
do
too
break
to
break
here
be
to
the
girl
with
the
invincible
spirit
no
matter
how
confused
she
soul
may
be
she
be
be
break
many
time
search
for
love
that
be
just
not
there
she
be
learn
she
lesson
now
put
up
she
wall
and
never
again
she
heart
she
will
bear
for
she
realize
that
in
the
end
a
body
be
still
a
body
no
matter
who
be
it
may
be
and
love
may
not
exist
for
anyone
so
we
should
all
just
settle
and
it
will
be
easy
but
she
will
never
give
in
all
she
need
be
herself
and
who
ever
she
be
that
day
but
this
she
will
never
know
because
life
be
surreal
when
all
she
do
be
feel
she
think
with
she
passion
see
the
world
through
she
heart
even
though
many
time
it
be
cold
desolate
and
dark
yet
at
the
same
time
she
can
see
that
there
may
be
hope
out
there
the
one
nobody
else
possibly
can
she
be
a
dreamer
and
a
idealist
life
great
pessimist
and
realist
she
be
a
contradiction
sure
but
never
a
hypocrite
because
in
she
soul
this
all
somehow
fit
she
want
to
explore
the
world
just
to
understand
what
she
be
think
dig
into
the
deep
corner
of
she
heart
to
understand
the
universe
she
often
lose
herself
though
and
who
she
use
to
be
she
can
never
know
yet
she
be
happy
like
this
she
be
free
and
to
no
one
she
will
commit
except
sometimes
when
she
be
all
alone
she
just
want
some
place
she
can
call
home
she
know
every
side
of
every
story
because
she
have
feel
absolutely
everything
often
all
at
once
this
contradiction
this
ability
to
see
in
way
that
no
one
else
can
be
it
a
curse
or
be
it
a
gift
even
she
cannot
understand
how
or
when
or
why
or
what
and
sometimes
she
do
not
even
know
if
it
be
she
want
something
more
even
when
she
be
sure
there
be
nothing
else
out
there
but
no
she
will
never
settle
especially
for
a
love
if
that
even
do
exist
she
will
always
hope
there
be
something
out
there
to
bring
she
bliss
but
she
do
not
expect
it
and
convince
herself
she
do
not
want
it
this
be
how
she
spirit
be
infinite
oh
how
I
hope
there
be
something
more
than
this
courage
when
it
happen

too
young

do
not
know
where
to
get
the
courage
to
overcome
that
fear
that
bother
you
I
sense
that

and
now

strength
to
overcome
my
weakness

brave
enough
to
stand
beside
you

enough
maybe
you
will
ask
why
be
you
brave
enough

answer
be
simple
and
true
brave
enough
because
of
you
my
world
the
day
be
through
the
sun
be
down
only
the
moon
seem
to
be
up
I
go
to
bed
I
lay
to
rest
I
open
my
eye
as
into
the
world
I
step
I
see
green
meadow
I
feel
the
sun
I
feel
content
as
I
look
around
I
keep
on
walk
down
the
lane
I
hear
the
giggle
of
kid
at
play
so
many
face
all
come
in
glee
the
cheer
the
laughter
everyone
at
peace
sing
and
dancing
all
around
one
man
I
take
a
step
forward
to
join
in
the
clan
we
all
come
together
no
color
no
race
we
all
want
to
shout
out
and
to
he
give
praise
we
pastor
we
savior
we
only
true
love
the
reign
of
mankind
if
only
in
he
we
trust
no
rain

be
my
world

be
my
world
I
share
it
with
you
fear
itself
be
undefined
I
lay
on
my
bed
soak
my
pillow
with
my
tear
I
try
to
remember
exactly
what
it
be
that
I
fear
be
it
the
passing
of
time
or
the
love
that
I
lack
be
it
the
mistake
that
ie
make
or
the
fact
that
I
bring
the
past
back
what
be
it
that
be
afraid
of
why
be
I
so
scared
be
it
the
people
ie
hurt
or
the
people
that
have
hurt
I
be
I
afraid
of
everything
that
I
cant
seem
to
see
be
it
the
love
of
a
friend
or
the
loss
of
my
family
be
it
the
possibility
that
my
life
can
end
in
a
tragedy
what
be
it
that
I
fear
most
what
do
my
eye
say
scared
of
be
it
the
sun
that
set
but
will
not
seem
to
rise
be
it
the
hope
that
I
have
that
always
seem
to
die
be
it
the
trust
of
a
person
that
I
cannot
begin
to
grasp
be
it
all
the
memory
of
my
horrid
past
be
it
I
can
it
possibly
be
that
the
thing
I
fear
most
be
the
thing
I
be
the
thing
that
I
try
to
understand
the
I
that
I
try
to
be
with
when
feel
sad
the
person
be
expect
to
be
be
that
what
I
fear
I
think
the
thing
I
fear
most
I
last
resort
a
plethora
of
predicament
race
in
my
mind
at
good
which
one
can
I
fathom
to
ponder
about
next
shall
I
even
think
of
act
upon
what
my
mind
stir
about
or
cry
my
soul
asleep
by
this
never
end
drought
what
will

career

the
word

this
there
be
no
easy
way
I
god
and
the
devil
ie
be
taint
and
shame
behind
my
pretty
facade
impure
by
lust
and
passion
corrupt
by
silly
illusion
my
soul
more
broken
than
my
heart
no
saint
can
save
I
now
a
sinner
with
no
savior
so
I
ask
god
to
just
take
I
now
I
want
to
feel
numb
forever
numb
cold
and
dead
I
do
not
know
innocence
can
be
a
sin
accessory
to
evil
plot
I
fall
against
he
will
leave
I
hopelessly
scared
trap
and
good
as
dead
no
one
know
get
a
secret
a
secret
I
could
not
trust
someone
to
keep
no
one
know
what
I
go
through
the
pain
and
misery
I
still
feel
no
one
know
except
I
god
and
the
devil
too
the
abuse
when
I
be
little
you
abuse
I
in
every
way
you
hurt
I
and
do
not
care
because
you
feel
no
shame
when
I
be
little
I
do
not
know
what
you
be
do
be
not
okay
when
I
be
little
I
would
cry
myself
to
sleep
I
would
try
to
hide
the
tear
and
try
to
hide
from
the
pain
bruise
all
over
no
more
lie
to
cover
up
now
no
one
to
talk
to
because
of
the
pain
finally
one
day
I
come
to
a
crossroad
do
I
tell
or
just
stay
hide
beneath
the
cover
all
day
you
now
be
in
prison
but
I
still
feel
the
pain
I
do
not
want
to
cry
no
more
because
it
be
tear
I
down
so
for
you
dear
daddy
I
will
not
shed
another
tear
the
end
suicide
suicide
tempt
I
every
time
I
swallow
all
because
this
destructive
life
lead
and
the
path
I
follow
invisible
to
myself
and
will
soon
be
to
everyone
who
once
care
many
never
believe
I
other
always
dare
hurt
everyone
whomever
have
my
back
the
only
way
I
deserve
to
leave
this
world
be
in
a
black
polyester
sack
my
life
what
life
be
all
down
the
drain
the
only
love
of
my
life
and
all
my
family
leave
in
pain
sorry
everyone
sorry
for
all
ie
do
but
the
pain
will
end
now
it
will
all
end
once
go
a
slice
to
wrist
a
cut
to
the
throat
sleeping
pill
for
the
pain
hallucinate
of
be
afloat
lift
to
the
heaven
that
I
could
only
dream
blood
drip
from
my
torso
like
melt
ice
cream
no
breath
no
life
no
soul
sorry
mom
sorry
dad
but
finally
I
feel
like
I
can
unfold
cry
for
help
I
thirst
for
help
before
it
be
to
late
I
stand
alone
in
the
darkness
as
I
lay
the
might
of
he
fist
feel
like
burn
coal
the
power
of
he
kick
ordain
the
soul
the
fire
in
he
eye
make
you
blind
but
my
cry
for
help
you
can
not
find
I
need
help
and
someone
to
help
I
now
he
will
not
let
I
leave
he
so
I
do
not
know
how
he
be
passive
and
control
as
he
push
I
around
my
body
roll
I
do
not
think
I
can
save
myself
someone
listen
to
my
cry
for
help
I
wish
I
know
who
I
be
you
tell
I
you
love
I
I
tell
you
the
same
I
do
not
know
who
I
be
it
a
shame
it
be
insane
I
want
to
love
I
and
you
like
I
love
my
own
son
inside
I
feel
dead
and
totally
numb
I
prick
my
finger
from
a
rose
with
a
thorn
a
reminder
that
we
child
be
of
the
purest
of
form
a
mirror
reflection
of
body
we
be
the
more
I
look
the
more
that
I
scar
the
more
that
I
scar
the
good
I
feel
in
this
crazy
world
that
seem
oh
so
unreal
the
whole
world
be
my
stage
it
help
cover
my
fear
for
we
be
all
merely
actor
accord
to
shakespeare
when
I
speak
of
the
truth
it
feel
like
a
noose
that
be
slowly
stretch
my
neck
and
then
when
I
lie
the
noose
open
wide
and
postpone
the
decent
to
my
death
I
feel
so
amused
or
maybe
confused
of
the
thought
that
run
through
my
head
its
just
so
unfair
with
this
thought
I
compare
my
whole
life
I
just
stay
ahead
be
it
I
be
it
you
be
it
life
be
it
truth
be
it
destiny
or
time
be
it
yours
be
it
mine
I
do
not
know
but
I
hope
it
come
soon
because
it
hurt
she
wear
my
shoe
she
ride
on
my
wing
share
she
dream
and
light
my
life
with
such
a
glow
I
be
she
protector
teacher
and
friend
and
will
be
she
mother
until
my
end
I
make
a
lot
of
mistake
not
know
the
cost
in
the
end
I
never
intend
to
hand
down
the
same
shoe
my
mother
hand
I
but
I
see
that
be
what
I
do
and
crush
all
she
dream
it
have
be
over
four
year
since
we
have
last
speak
but
never
a
day
pass
that
I
do
not
send
my
love
to
the
star
above
and
ask
for
a
angel
to
open
up
they
wing
and
take
my
place
and
guide
she
to
follow
all
she
dream
she
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
that
will
never
be
replace
this
be
how
a
mother
love
be
always
mean
to
be
I
hope
that
someday
we
path
will
cross
again
and
I
can
hold
she
in
my
arm
and
tell
she
I
understand
good
than
she
could
ever
know
I
understand
what
I
do
in
pass
the
shoe
to
she
if
I
could
take
it
all
back
believe
I
I
would
but
for
now
it
be
out
of
my
hand
go
why
do
I
stay
when
I
want
to
go
be
it
because
I
have
hope
or
maybe
it
be
because
I
do
not
want
to
be
alone
I
stay
and
all
I
do
be
complain
complain
that
I
might
be
go
insane
insane
of
the
thought
that
it
might
be
my
fault
but
who
be
to
blame
be
it
I
or
be
it
he
neither
one
of
we
will
go
although
we
know
we
must
go
all
we
do
be
ignore
the
pain
of
all
the
word
we
exchange
I
know
I
must
go
but
I
do
not
know
if
I
go
I
will
be
alone
but
why
do
I
stay
only
to
hear
he
say
you
be
to
blame
for
all
my
unhappiness
and
pain
I
know
not
to
blame
for
the
choice
he
have
make
so
I
stay
hope
he
will
grow
grow
in
love
and
be
consol
know
I
will
never
go
I
thank
you
you
keep
it
real
you
tell
no
lie
I
trust
you
word
and
you
say
that
it
be
okay
to
cry
hide
from
a
ocean
of
lie
from
the
people
close
to
I
but
you
you
reveal
they
all
you
answer
question
never
ask
and
you
show
no
regret
and
with
that
I
thank
you
wish
the
truth
be
lie
expect
a
laugh
and
you
tell
I
that
it
be
all
a
joke
the
truth
hit
I
then
stab
I
then
kill
I
a
thousand
time
I
cry
that
night
with
the
never
end
thought
of
the
truth
I
think
I
know
my
life
I
think
I
understand
it
all
but
you
open
my
eye
and
unwrapp
the
hurtful
truth
and
I
thank
you
for
be
there
to
hold
my
hand
through
it
all
and
I
can
never
thank
you
enough
for
open
the
closet
of
skeleton
the
voyage
the
vessel
memory
haunt
the
gloom
of
the
night
I
survey
its
change
shape
since
day
of
yore
as
I
stumble
tremble
and
fumble
to
the
fore
the
mute
face
stare
with
hope
as
they
might
dream
of
the
new
world
come
at
first
light
the
pining
youth
cross
the
threshold
of
the
door
they
be
visibly
stricken
and
shake
to
the
core
we
be
ghastly
haggard
shell
and
fill
with
fright
as
we
modern
voyage
sail
into
the
shade
of
night
my
heart
break
a
mother
fear
a
sister
tear
my
soul
quake
a
brother
near
my
earth
shake

you
fear
and
all
that
you
have
run
away
from

come
back
for
they
revenge
will
you
face
it
or
run
away

away
like
you
do
before
let
you
friend
fall
like
you

before
or
face
it
like
you
should
help

like
you
should
chin
hold
high
and
heart
strong
you
blood

the
lighting

you
will
not
run
away
you
will
fight
the
circle

but
not
get
too
far
the
path
you
on
will
cause
you
no
change
but
in
you
deep
dream

suffer
much
pain
will
you
expand
yourself
or
sit
and
cry
you
want
comfort
warmth
and
hope
and
by
yourself

be
like
catching
smoke
you
bend
and
twist
you
scream
and
yell
for
what
can
you
do
when
it
feel
like

much
space
for
seed
that
need
to
grow
what
happen
then
before
this
time
how
do
it
come
to
be
that
she
would
find
herself
so
hurt
and
long
to
be
free
the
story
tell
do
not
ring
true
to
what
be
inside
she
head
why
she
live
each
day
with
joy
not
such
a
aching
dread
when
will
the
past
come
forth
to
show
she
how
it
all
begin
till
then
she
grieve
in
lonesome
silence
coping
while
she
can
if
perhaps
I
sit
here
hold
deep
inside
feeling
that
other
wish
to
hide
confide
in
I
the
trouble
go
but
in
I
they
grow
and
grow
I
know
I
say
I
could
handle
it
but
I
wonder
as
I
think
about
it
my
heart
scream
for
sweet
release
all
it
want
be
the
promise
of
peace
the
promise
I
freely
give
to
other
can
I
promise
myself
above
other
let
my
promise
out
to
you
if
you
will
hold
I
as
I
would
you
will
trust
you
if
you
will
I
god
please
protect
I
hold
I
and
never
let
I
go
but
if
you
do
I
want
you
to
know
I
never
mean
to
go
away
my
heart
release
it
be
own
way
perhaps
through
fear
it
decide
to
go
but
if
that
be
it
I
do
not
know
sometimes
it
act
without
I
but
if
so
now
I
be
free
fear
be
only
in
we
mind
take
over
all
we
time
I
awake
from
the
weir
dream
I
look
I
realize
it
be
not
a
dream

lie
in
the
road
in
so
much
pain
lie
in
a
pool
of

want
to
scream
silent

in
the
distance
I
hear

must
be

all
hazy
and
black
I

blurred
figure
run
up

try
to

I
not
ready
to
die
someone
should
have
tell
that

and
now
I
must
die
because
no
one
care
to
tell
he
not
to
drink
and
drive
as
I
lie
here
my
breath
get
short
on
the
cold
unforgiving
road
all
I
can
think
about
be
the
blackness
coldness

can
save
I

alone
in
the
dark
as
she
look
back
there
be
spark
she
can
hear
the
whisper
the
step
the
jump
she
can
hear
the
quickness
just
like
dart
she
walk
at
a
pace
not
too
fast
she
hear
the
whisper
this
make
she
gasp
she
run
as
fast
as
she
can
until
she
hear
the
step
again
a
hollow
speech
hard
and
cold
she
want
to
run
but
it
be
to
bold
she

and
run
until
she
find
the
sound

and
as
I
hold
this

on

when
I

finally
on

one
job
that
pay
food
and

next
to

for
a
while
calm
as
can
be
and
quite
still
till
she
fly
away
and
perch
up
on
my
sill
she
continue
sing
a
different
song
loud
than
before
curiously
I
watch
she
and
start
to
get
bored
I
think
to
myself
I
be
tired
still
and
want
to
go
to
bed
so
I
take
my
pillow
sleepily
and

up
my
head

wait
a
while
and
remove
the
pillow
till
I
see
she
be
still
perch
on
my
window
sill
I
start
to
turn
red
I
get
up
to

the
window
close
and

to
go
to

when
I
see
what

where
there
be
triumph
and
happiness

stir
not

be
hang
by

with

in
hope
that
nicholas
soon
would
be
there
the
child
be
nestle
all
snug
in
they
bed
while
vision
of
sugar
plum
dance
in
they
head
and

in
she
kerchief
and
I
in
my
cap
have
just
settle
we
brain
for
a
long
winter
nap
when
out
on
the
lawn
there
arise
such
a
clatter
I
spring
from
my
bed
to
see
what
be
the
matter
away
to
the
window
I
fly
like
a
flash
tore
open
the
shutter
and
throw
up
the
sash
the
moon
on
the
breast
of
the
new
fall
snow
give
a
lustre
of
midday
to
object
below
when
what
to
my
wonder
eye
do
appear
but
a
miniature
sleigh
and
eight
tiny
rein
deer
with
a
little
old
driver
so
lively
and
quick
I
know
in
a
moment
he
must
be
Nick
more
rapid
than
eagle
he
courser
they
come
and
he
whistle
and
shout
and
call
they
by
name
now
dasher
now
dancer
now
prancer
and
vixen
on
comet
on
cupid
on
dond
and
blixen
to
the
top
of
the
porch
to
the
top
of
the
wall
now
dash
away
dash
away
dash
away
all
as
leave
that
before
the
wild
hurricane
fly
when
they
meet
with
a
obstacle
mount
to
the
sky
so
up
to
the
housetop
the
courser
they
fly
with
the
sleigh
full
of
toy
and
nicholas
too
and
then
in
a
twinkling
I
hear
on
the
roof
the
prancing
and
paw
of
each
little
hoof
as
I
draw
in
my
head
and
be
turn
around
down
the
chimney
nicholas
come
with
a
bind
he
be
dress
all
in
fur
from
he
head
to
he
foot
and
he
clothes
be
all
tarnish
with
ash
and
soot
a
bundle
of
toy
he
have
fling
on
he
back
and
he
look
like
a
pedler
just
open
he
pack
he
eye
how
they
twinkle
he
dimple
how
merry
he
cheek
be
like
rose
he
nose
like
a
cherry
he
droll
little
mouth
be
draw
up
like
a
bow
and
the
beard
on
he
chin
be
as
white
as
the
snow
the
stump
of
a
pipe
he
hold
tight
in
he
tooth
and
the
smoke
it
encircle
he
head
like
a
wreath
he
have
a
broad
face
and
a
little
round
belly
that
shake
when
he
laugh
like
a
bowl
full
of
jelly
he
be
chubby
and
plump
a
right
jolly
old
elf
and
I
laugh
when
I
see
he
in
spite
of
myself
a
wink
of
he
eye
and
a
twist
of
he
head
soon
give
I
to
know
I
have
nothing
to
dread
he
speak
not
a
word
but
go
straight
to
he
work
and
fill
all
the
stocking
then
turn
with
a
jerk
and
lay
he
finger
aside
of
he
nose
and
give
a
nod
up
the
chimney
he
rise
he
spring
to
he
sleigh
to
he
team
give
a
whistle
and
away
they
all
fly
like
the
down
of
a
thistle
but
I
hear
he
exclaim
ere
he
drive
out
of
sight
happy
Christmas
to
all
and
to
all
a
good
night
rage
I

close
and
squeeze
you
tight
and
feel

a
moment
of
truth
my
dear
love
I
want
to
share
my
thought
my
feeling
and
what
make
I
despair
I
want
to
share
with
you
what
make
I
happy
what
make
I
feel
blue
so
you
can
sense
that
my
love
be
honest
and
true
every
day
not
a
single
minute
pass
by
without
you
in
it
you
skin
you
voice
you
body
and
you
touch
all
of
this
moment
I
miss
they
so
much
you
be
so
present
so
deep
in
my
heart
and
we
soul
I
just
know
will
never
part
but
circumstance
and
distance
can
be
so
overwhelming
they
close
door
and
create
doubt
and
we
start
blame
there
be
action
of
mine
and
I
know
that
for
sure
that
feel
so
wrong
though
my
intention
be
pure
they
be
painful
and
impossible
to
bear
and
you
feel
it
be
all
so
unfair
you
run
from
yourself
there
be
no
place
to
hide
it
just
hurt
you
so
deep
it
hurt
you
heart
and
you
pride
then
I
worry
that
if
I
continue
to
stay
will
it
be
wrong
and
will
I
be
in
you
way
I
fear
that
I
be
not
at
all
what
you
need
and
that
this
truth
will
make
my
heart
break
and
bleed
then
I
sit
here
and
wipe
away
my
tear
wish
you
could
kiss
away
my
fear
if
only
you
know
how
I
miss
and
need
you
embrace
and
you
touch
I
know
I
hide
from
my
thought
and
my
fear
and
I
know
at
this
time
I
do
not
seem
near
but
you
break
down
this
wall
with
the
strength
of
you
love
and
then
I
feel
bless
from
god
above
my
love
for
you
run
so
deep
through
my
vein
that
I
dream
of
you
in
spite
of
the
pain
what
I
love
about
you
the
sparkle
in
you
eye
the
warmth
of
you
skin
you
breath
on
my
neck

I

touch
of
you
hand

smell
of

naughtiness
in
you
smile
that
strength
in
you
stare

educate
witty
funny
and
true
so
next
time

I
want
you
to
know
just
where
I
stand
I
do
not
need
fire
or
glasses
of
wine
I
do
not
need
beach
to
forget
about
time
and
even
though
we
have

and
more
it
you
love
that
make
I
stay
it
be
you
I
adore
I
love
you
with
all
of
my
heart
eyelid
dancer
eyelid
dancing
I
on
the
left
and
you
on
the
right
the
way
we
lay
we
body
the
start
of
the
night
my
head
on
two
pillow
as
yours
lay
on
one
tired
from
the
day
and
all
we
have
do
one
arm
under
pillow
the
other
keep
you
warm
pull
you
in
close
during
thunder
and
storm
I
still
remember
the
sweet
scent
of
you
hair
as
we
close
we
eye
and
I
hold
you
for
prayer
the
rise
and
fall
of
breath
from
you
chest
would
remind
I
of
that
day
that
god
have
bless
you
face
would
go
soft
and
lip
would
yawn
you
would
fall
asleep
with
the
television
still
on
middle
of
the
night
you
house
stay
warm
the
fan
on
high
be
always
the
norm
steal
the
blanket
and
kick
down
the
sheet
the
only
pillow
you
have
now
lay
at
you
foot
sometimes
be
wake
while
there
you
still
lay
creep
to
you
bedside
and
kneel
as
to
pray
I
would
lean
in
close
as
if
to
steal
a
kiss
this
moment
of
affection
be
the
one
that
I
miss
I
have
sit
and
watch
while
you
lay
there
and
snore
iId
sometimes
fall
asleep
with
my
head
on
the
floor
you
always
think
you
sleep
without
peep
instead
of
count
they
you
like
a
sheep
you
body
lay
still
cept
for
the
rise
and
fall
of
you
beautiful
body
that
lay
there
in
sprawl
but
the
most
memorable
part
of
that
sleepless
night
be
not
the
snoring
the
prayer
or
absence
of
light
it
be
the
way
in
which
you
eye
would
flicker
beneath
lid
and
lash
I
would
try
not
to
snicker
to
I
it
be
funny
to
just
watch
they
move
as
if
they
be
dancer
step
to
groove
I
could
only
guess
what
you
mind
would
dream
maybe
thought
of
we
future
and
how
it
would
seem
would
it
be
a
uphill
battle
a
test
for
all
time
or
simply
step
in
a
stairwell
that
together
we
have
climb
most
of
the
morning
you
have
wake
with
a
smile
and
some
you
sleep
in
for
at
least
a
little
while
but
now
this
memory
be
just
write
in
line
and
file
in
a
cabinet
in
the
back
of
my
mind
memory
of
you
sleep
snoring
eye
wide
shut
now
my
heart
beating
bleed
crimson
and
cut
you
eyelid
would
flutter
as
you
eye
would
dance
and
pray
to
god
to
just
give
I
the
chance
to
fix
what
be
do
and
to
right
the
wrong
of
the
poor
choice
that
be
hide
for
oh
so
long
this
be
the
thought
I
now
remember
the
most
the
memory
in
my
heart
I
still
hold
so
close
time
I
sit
by
you
side
as
night
be
still
grey
all
through
the
morning
before
dark
turn
to
day
I
have
ask
he
to
bless
this
love
have
forsiken
take
for
grant
and
steal
for
the
taking
unfortunately
I
receive
a
different
kind
of
answer
but
you
will
always
remain
my
eyelid
dancer
treasure
we
own
when
my
hand
be
wrinkle
so
it
be
you
that
I
will
still
want
you
know
as
my
hair
turn
silver
and
gray

I
as
I
be
yesterday

long
red
hair

in
the
breeze

each
other
with
ease
now
in
the
park

hand
I
hold
you
keep
I
warm
as
it
turn
cold

sit
on
a
bench
and
feed
the
bird

single
word

to
be
hear
remembrance
of
year

by

glance
and
for
hour
how

no
reason

rain
a
cold
winter
night

hair
blow
in
the
wind
somebody
take
my
hand

eye
they
close
as
I
breathe
in
deep
you
run
through
my
mind
and
my
life
be
complete
I
open
my
eye
but
you
be
still
not
there
no
one
could
take
you
place
with
you
my
heart
I
share
a
cold
afternoon
hand
as
cold
as
ice
thought
go
through
my
mind
my
feeling
be
concise
lie
in
you
arm
we
be
the
perfect
match
the
distance
be
discourage
yet
still
I
be
attach
sit
by
the
fire
think
in
a
distant
stare
wait
under
streetlight
nobody
could
compare
when
love
begin
I
always
know
that
love
would
come
find
I
someday
but
never
do
I
know
that
it
would
be
you
who
be
head
my
way
you
catch
I
off
guard
and
take
I
by
surprise
but
you
simply
captivated
I
the
same
way
you
do
when
I
look
into
you
eye
it
be
true
that
every
good
and
perfect
gift
be
from
above
you
be
present
to
I
as
a
beautifully
package
gift
full
of
humor
talent
intelligence
beauty
and
love
it
be
not
find
the
perfect
person
but
learn
to
see
a
imperfect
person
perfectly
we
all
have
we
flaw
but
when
I
view
you
through
my
eye
perfection
be
all
I
see
from
when
you
laugh
to
when
you
be
upset
I
still
love
the
little
thing
you
do
especially
hear
you
laugh
and
see
you
nose
wrinkle
the
same
way
mine
do
too
come
into
this
relationship
have
be
hard
at
time
but
we
have
make
it
through
I
know
as
long
as
we
be
on
this
journey
together
there
be
nothing
that
we
do
sometimes
I
wonder
if
what
we
have
be
too
good
to
be
true
too
scared
to
get
my
heart
break
and
scared
of
the
thought
of
lose
you
but
in
the
end
I
trust
in
the
author
and
perfecter
of
what
I
believe
because
what
we
ask
for
in
he
we
in
return
shall
receive
where
you
treasure
be
you
heart
will
be
also
be
how
the
saying
go
I
may
not
know
what
tomorrow
may
bring
for
god
be
the
only
one
who
know
the
one
thing
I
do
know
be
that
you
be
my
one
and
only
a
treasure
in
my
heart
that
I
want
to
devote
my
whole
life
to
completely
I
know
I
do
not
need
to
prove
my
feeling
to
know
they
be
true
because
what
ie
know
in
my
past
do
not
come
close
to
the
experience
share
with
you
have
the
experience
of
be
in
relationship
before
however
this
be
the
first
time
ie
be
truly
happy

that
there
be
no
reason
for
all
this
pain
the
time
it
take

be
bury
deep
inside
to

to
be
the

always
be
strong
the
feeling
be

too
deep
the
blood

wound
in
the
heart

another
mark
if

only
know
what
ie
be
through
or
maybe
you
could
take
a
walk
in
my
shoe
not
fake
not
a
doll
I
just
do
not
think
the
same
in
any
way
so
where
do
my
soul
go

do
I
ever
let
it
runaway

happen
to
that
girl

I
but
do
they
change
she
if
only
I
would
know
the
man
it
be
hard
to
describe
how
I
feel
right
now
I
want
to
explain
it
but
I
do
not
know
how
I
believe
its
come
to
this
it
we
world
not
just
he
no
matter
how
hard
we
try
the
man
can
never
hear
we
cry
we
could
scream
and
yell
but
he
be
in
he
heaven
while
we
be
in
we
hell
the
little
boy
want
he
acceptance
but
the
man
keep
he
distance
the
little
boy
have
so
many
why
but
the
man
will
not
open
he
eye
the
little
girl
just
want
she
dad
but
the
man
do
not
understand
the
little
girl
just
want
to
be
kiss
and
hug
but
all
the
man
do
be
shrug
the
woman
just
want
he
but
the
light
be
get
dim
she
love

with
all
she
heart
but
the
man
keep
tear

apart
no
matter
how

while

I
want
to
know
one
more
thing
with
my
last
bit
of
strength
be
this
it
be
this
the
end
complicated
family
so
many
tear
shed
in
the
dark
of
night
hide
away
in
we
private
thought
only
to
be
shelve
with
morning
first
light
because
of
no
courage
to
speak
of
the
pain
this
part
of
we
life
remain
the
same
mother
and
father
sister
and
brother
gather
for
holiday
they
hope
will
heal
while
gather
together
share
a
meal
what
they
bring
back
from
the
past
perhaps
they
will
be
able
to
bed
it
at
last
year
of
analysis
a
lifetime
of
good
can
be
shattered
with
just
one
word
maybe
a
look
or
gesture
of
scorn
any
of
which
destroy
year
of
progress
all
the
good
overturn
at
least
that
be
what
be
tell
over
and
over
again
I
sit
by
a
letter
address
to
my
sister
no
courage
to
post
it
no
gut
to
muster
ie
write
the
thing
I
need
to
say
will
she
get
my
meaning
or
stray
away
into
she
own
thought
to
calm
she
that
day
thought
of
comfort
truth
not
portray
it
must
be
nice
to
be
the
favor
child
of
choice
to
not
know
the
feeling
of
a
life
not
rejoice
to
know
through
life
whatever
wrong
you
have
do
in
the
eye
of
the
parent
you
will
remain
number
one
to
not
know
what
it
be
like
to
give
of
you
soul
for
recognition
that
you
will
never
ever
know
stuck
in
the
past
stick
in
the
past
old
memory
old
action
old
regret
it
seem
someone
never
forget
they
seem
to
return
over
and
over
again
when
will
they
disappear
when
when
when
why
be
the
detail
so
important
they
be
not
even
related
to
we
do
they
really
have
to
add
up
or
have
to
be
continuous
feel
like
be
stick
in
the
past
be
curious
to
how
long
it
will
last
it
eat
away
the
present
of
so
fast
that
even
we
future
will
become
the
past
my
papa
three
year
ago
